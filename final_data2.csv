P2e's have emerged as the new rescuer of crypto as it gives the user an opportunity to earn during dips.

If you think a little deeper then this - you can still ""freeze"" it because the folks can't spend their funds anyways.

There is need to be more talk why a $5K price target justified for ETH. We need more talk about these blockchain‚Äôs utility. Right now, ETH is much more useable as a financial tool because its gas fees is significantly cheaper than before - all thanks to ETH price taking a dump. 

The purpose of ETH is to facilitate trust less and permission less financial transactions. It is not about pumping the price so overleveraged longs can go to the moon and achieve financial independence. That toxic moon mentality is why people see crypto as just the greater fool game.

Everyone talks about crypto as commodity and ETH like oil. But do you see commodity traders talking about oil mooning to $1000 as sustainable?

Btk under 10k Omg this is embarrassing Had to check if this was /promoted What tech developments? Bitcoin is, in general, opposed to rapid tech developments. Hopium at its best.  The days of cheap money are gone. At best we‚Äôll trade sideways for months. Crypto's decline is the results of radical left policies.  If they had their way we would be natives like in Africa or South America.  Yes, under such conditions after the willful destruction of supply chains, infrastructure, and capital, crypto would be of extremely limited use. Cardano to $10 BTC can and will absolutely hit 100k and higher. But it's going to 5k first. Honestly bottom is probably 15k like 20k is hurt enough but not enough in crypto only the worthy will have the golden ticket to 10k And it could just as easily got to 2k, why are these pump and dumps being promoted Both bitcoin and eth are absolute garbage. Finish your play tho guys if you‚Äôre not dollar costing down in whatever you are in on, then you‚Äôre truly f*cking up In german we have the saying:

Wenn der Hahn kr√§ht auf dem Mist, √§ndert sich das Wetter oder bleibt wie es ist.

Roughly translates to "" when the rooster crows on the dirtpile, the Weather will cange or it will stay as it is.""

Of course it can rise, it might as well crash without recovery. Who knows. Yeah....nah...... One of the issues I have with this logic is that with older projects like ETH and BTC, you end up with a lot of bag holders looking to dump at any hint of a rebound in prices. Investing in new projects like CNDL means that there are no bag holders to dump on you, particularly if there was no VC funding round. BTC will gapfill at 7400 then go into the hundreds of thousands by 2030. 

Just know btc going 60k>8k>150k is the equivalent of any other stock going from $60>$8>$150 (which is gamestop single month price action tbh) and doesn't actually represent spectacular gains. BTC bros seem blinded by the big numbers and dont understand bigger picture. 

Even btc going straight to 100k today really isnt that spectacular when you think of it as any other stock going from $20 to $100, which is price action all too common in this liquidity driven era",0.9991

On the other hand its trackaability is a double edgedd sword which might be quite awful in mor precarious markets  like those in latam. Of course theres no need to eliminate cash just because you shifted to crypto (in fact, even if its just to keep up with the timeselectricity or tech fails you I would rather have every single crypto minted backed up by cash), and it minting a crypto doesnt mean it will be the official currency of the country either, or the only one but I feel like that would be the unavoidable final scenario Cartelcoin

0,The media admits their job is to ‚Äúcontrol exactly what people think‚Äù,https://v.redd.it/aiyyfjvzawt81,,818,120,False," ""That is our job"" honestly fuck these people. Disgusting! Reporters used to report just the fact‚Äôs sadly those days are gone. And they have the balls to say it out loud They are only there to sell ads. Political ads as well. The news industry is well...an industry. Big surprise And they are doing theirs job really good Not that it changes the statement, but this is 5 years old. Who actually watches the ‚Äònews‚Äô anymore Wow We need a purge. We need to clear these scum out. We need to clear them all out. We need a fresh start. When you accidentally say the quite part out loud. MSM does not employ or feature journalists...they employ ""personalities"". Those personalities are carefully groomed to attract segments of the population determined by psychological systems and studies to determine the best way to influence those particular individuals based on the reach of any particular personality. It's also a major reason why they feature so many different personalities to deliver ""the news"" in the prospect of reaching many more individuals who ""identify"" with one or more of those on-air personas.. No wonder only boomers watch that shit. The media controls what we think. But what about the fact that there are nations that literally steal money from other governments. Just look at the good old USA. As an American. I'm proud to say that we left Afghanistan and decided to take all their money with us. Here's another one. I don't like your politics (Russia) and what you do. So I'm just going to go ahead and not just sanction you but then freeze all of your assets, take them from you, and then turn around and sell them. No, I'm not a thief. I'm doing it for the good of the world.... This is why crypto is so important. News is a business, they never told the truth and why should they? If you believe on their bs these days that's on you! 
They aren't here to tell the truth, they are here to make üí∞üí∞ The libbys will tell you that you‚Äôre reading into this too much‚Ä¶ if you aren‚Äôt disgusted by this video, watch it again No, an idiot who works in media spilled the beans on what *she* thinks is her job. You're being misleading, which isn't any better than what they're doing.

Also, what the fvck does this have to do with crypto? If you watched the entire show and had any context... what they were talking about was how DJT mind fucked the whole country and she was attempting to say that it is their job as journalists to investigate it and report on it. Obviously not that DJT took their job of brainwashing the country and destroying democracy. OP is misleading you with a 10 second clip with zero context...

Journalism is a vital part of protecting our democracy and attacking journalists with misinformation is exactly what TFG would want you to be doing. Great work OP... Only people watching their show are in this sub... well if you work for popular new sites then yeah its true in part since you are working under governament orders Next week this sub can start posting about trans athletes. You're all going to regret this not keeping these subs apolitical. You'll tank the whole thing What does this have to do with crypto? I doubt a single person on Reddit actually watches Morning Joe. Brilliant! Fuckwits u/BlastingGasses do you mean this? Dafiq And it works. Clearly Someone said ""the news is what we say is the news"" Media is just a propaganda of each faction (dems or gop). They just want u to be a puppet by putting fears on you. That‚Äôs how they get elected. MSM is pure propaganda. Turn off your TV Liberal media. It‚Äôs working honestly. Just look at Reddit. Well, the only ones they can control are people glued to their tv screens. I've always seen past their propaganda having studied mass communication. Now, i just use them to figure out top plastic waste producers. Really useful when i want to monetize single-use package data with Plastik Are we really acting like news stations arent aware that people believe whatever they tell them? They are not exposing themselves, its not evil if you report the truth if thats your job, wich they are implying. Haha Elon paid her to say this... Ok where to begin‚Ä¶ the standard that abc, cbs, nbc, cnn, msnbc is a lot higher for one than it is ever* than that of any right wing media‚Ä¶ this is not bias : it‚Äôs actually a favor trump did for so called mainstream media!  Lol.  Because early in trumps presidency he complained that the so called mainstream media wouldn‚Äôt spew his specific narrative and called them liars, fake  news in return : etc‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why fox became his go to‚Ä¶ who has the real integrity! Yep‚Ä¶that‚Äôs why trump goes in on any of the latter‚Ä¶ now if you listen closely to any one channels they actual say whether accounts have been verified or not! They mention what any real professionals have to say to cover their tracks‚Ä¶Do any right wing channels do that?! Bet not!!!!!  What you get is a narrative- that‚Äôs true!!! But is that lies? No!  For instance Fox News spewed election fraud and their staff proudly said it was rigged but it wasn‚Äôt proved time again it wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ but when it is in your face none of you idiots choose to accept!  But who do you keep blaming and discrediting???  Fox News got off with a slap on wrist and keeps on with the bs and has no standard to follow‚Ä¶ If any of you go with the conspiracy narrative and folks are out to get you : you are just fucked in the head!  If that was the case you be dead by now or worse off! That‚Äôs the problem with you folks that spew the bs by the right : they use you for further divide whereas none of what you spew has any facts or truth ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all been disproved time again!!!! By the way her point was taken out of context and was meant to be sarcastic‚Ä¶ but none of you understand sarcasm or who she was refer to when she made that comment!!! It be nice to know what the full clip is‚Ä¶ She looks like Glen Close from Fatal Attraction (1987) but with a Brady Bunch hairstyle.

It should have said: ""Cryptos you should have invested in in the year 2021, or before"" Interesting. People are generally going to have different lists, and that's ok. For me, I'd go with ATOM, SCRT, CRO I understand your concerns, guys, and I thank you ror your inputs. Definitely gonna check out your suggestions. For the list, I specifically chose them because they were the relatively safer bets. Crypto is highly speculative, and with the current market sentiment, we need safe choices. Of course, nobody knows the future, and nobody can 100% predict which coins will provide the best yields, hence the disclaimer. These are already blown projects. Hidden gems like SYLO, SWASH, I believe should come up on lists like this one. I honestly don't care who comes in first because I have 60 percent of the list in my possession, which is quite a fascinating list. Tower and Icons, on the other hand, are in my bag because they have good use cases, are low capped, and have high growth potential. Very good picks, but why do you think both SYS and ALGO are not good for investment? Because from my research they are very good solana is 3rd on this list üòÇ thats funny! Cardano is not even on ur list despite the defi explosion thats going to make ADA one of the most valuable coins in 2022. Buy Vader interesting list you have got up there . seems you missed out on $SYLO because from my end, Metaverse, Web3, Nft are what is trending this 2022 and only $Sylo has got all incorporated . No actual hidden gems here So... not DOT.? I just bought more DOT yesterday. Already ruined 2022. It's a little unusual to see Bitcoin not in the first place in this list. I somehow got used to Bitcoin always being the first. At the same time, SOLANA, in my opinion, deservedly placed in third place. This cryptocurrency showed very good growth in 2021 and probably SOLANA turned out to be my best investment usdt. Interesting. People are generally going to have different lists, and that's ok. For me, I'd go with ATOM, SCRT, SYS and LUXY Xno should be on here, a lot of people struggle to find real world use of cryptos, but xno‚Äôs ultra low fees let‚Äôs me micro pay my friends for all kinds of things.  

Vvs , hop on the crypto com band wagon with their first cronos coin , if you believe in CRO, why not believe in their products

How do you not have lrc? 

Sol is corporate trash 

Theta has so much potential, odd you left that one out too Anyone hold of heard much of Jacy they seem to be doing solid things. Is this satire or a history paper? I mean this list is old news in my books. This is the year inter-operability web three and metaverse. Interesting. But I'd go for Bricktrade's BRKT for now üòÑ Really surprised I didn't see ALBT there, taking into context the number of products they are launching this year I believe they deserve a spot as the products launch would create more utility to the token and you know what's happens next.... Terrible list, only 2 of the coins I hold are on there. The author needs to try again. I don't need a list to tell me what to invest in lmao. I know how to think for myself.

0,My goal with crypto is to have a secure life with me and my family and get out of poverty.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v2c6rd/my_goal_with_crypto_is_to_have_a_secure_life_with/,"As some backstory, I worked 48 hours a week and there are times I get severely stressed and there are times I get high fevers. Even if I am not feeling well, people at the company tell me to show up or don't bother coming in anymore. I didn't have a choice; I couldn't find another job, so I put up with it all because I needed to pay my bills and eat.

That job was a mental nightmare for me every day. The whole company itself is toxic. Before I resigned, I made sure I had enough and invested some crypto and stocks and mutual funds. Fast forward today I found a better high paying job that was loads better than my previous job. Not only that, my crypto earnings had increased even better than my stocks and mutual funds.

With crypto, I want to secure myself and my family with pride. I never want to be in a situation where I have no choice but to put up with anything, and I'm hoping that crypto can help me with that. I also want to invest long term and make sure I don‚Äôt get emotional with the roller coaster ride with all the dips that have been happening in various cryptos. I was an early investor and fortunately it didn't affect me.

I admit there are times where there my thoughts are divided between HODLING or Staking my crypto with [defi protocols](https://app.aave.com/) and/or [crypto staking platforms](https://haruinvest.com/) till I'm confident to rely on my earnings, as well as whatever my future family will be OR selling it off because of the dip (and the news about LUNA) and start living a luxurious life showing off my nice house and new car but I learned that not letting people know your ups and downs of financial status is a lot better.

I'm attempting to train myself to work smarter rather than harder. I just want to get out of this cycle of poverty where I spend the majority of my income on bills, food and the endless cycle of living from paycheck to paycheck.",184,80,False," What about stocks? ETFs? Mutual Funds? Don't just place your eggs in one basket bruh. Diversify. I don't need to have a lot of money; I just don‚Äôt like being poor. But I wouldn't mind being rich as well. Invest in income-producing assets so that you can live off the income while the assets grow. I want enough financial freedom to spend time with my family and do what I want when I want, while also supporting technologies that could potentially do the same for many more people. When lambo though Mine is to get rich.

But in all seriousness, I work as a freelancer so I‚Äôve never really had a pension pot, so my aim is to create one at a relatively fast pace using crypto and also some short term gains to enjoy life with less stress. Good work mate , seems like your making solid progress üëè all the best , and let those goals motivate you !! Hey at least you‚Äôre being honest. I'm going to panic out if I hear ""I'm in it for the tech"" one more time, despite the fact that most people buy to sell higher later. You've decided to invest in crypto for all the right reasons. I hope your earnings allow you to live comfortably! Good luck! Mine too. I'm in crypto for the long haul, not for the quick buck. With crypto, I hope to attain at least one life objective. Many people, I believe, are in your shoes. I wish you all the best. Hope you‚Äôre using a hard wallet or you‚Äôre just saving up money for someone else to take Aren't we all now? Good luck to you sir. That is something I believe most of us desire. Personally, I'd like to retire early. Well good luck. I share your sentiments. I'm hoping that crypto will become the new currency. I‚Äôm looking forward to that future. I'm in the same boat. Of course, becoming filthy rich would be great, but I honestly just want to feel financially comfortable regardless of what I choose to do with my life. That‚Äôs right. fiat mines can be toxic NGL. I just want to make some money. I came for the money and I'm still here for it! I'm tempted to say you have almost gotten it all figured out but then spreading funds across different yield protocols is the safest approach to take when seeking big returns for me and personally, I think Spoolfi is among the lowest risk DeFi platforms to make that possible, given the flexibility it gives users to put their funds through multiple channels without paying gas fees several times and at the same time given optimum yield. I completely agree with you, OP; I feel that everyone wishes the same for themselves and those around them. Mostly this achieved by hard work, upgrading your social and work skills every year, but by all means use crypto in a balanced investment portfolio. You‚Äôre going to want to invest in the stock market, not crypto. Start a business

Crypto isn‚Äôt going to get you out of poverty. I don't think cryptocurrencies are a good instrument for ensuring financial stability. Remember, it's a system where you can only make money by selling at a higher price, and there is no value created in the process. Worse, in systems like Bitcoin you are also paying the miners, meaning that investors lose money overall. And that's not even talking about market manipulation and insider trading.

Crypto is a shitty game and the odds are rigged against small-time investors. Investing in cryptocurrencies can be a side business, but don't make it your main business because there is too much instability in the cryptocurrency market. If you make one mistake, you can lose a lot, if not everything. Unless you can make a very stable and long-term profitable project, but I don't think that's possible. All profitable and losing projects have a time limit. Although I also made a lot of money in crypto, I didn't give up my main business. Isn't it better to make money together with your main business and side business? If you want security and stability crypto is not it Instead you are now more in poverty Welcome to the Pipe dream club. Come and throw your money away. I'm in it too for financial freedom although I get attracted to the tech side more often than not. I like Defi and staking as well. Right now I stake ATOM, NGM, JUNO, CRE and EVMOS via Keplr, and GREEN on the [GreenHouseDEX](http://greenhousedex.com). Next week I will add OCEAN to my staking bag once they release OCEAN V4 on the 8th. Everyone stop working and just buy BTC. You'll be a millionaire in 2 weeks. Elon Musk became the richest when he stopped working and began smoking pot. That is my goal as well. I HODL and I stake as well. I have been holding OCEAN for long now, Bancor staking APY is low, but once V4 launches this month, there will be an incentivized single asset staking from ocean team

NGM has give me a great yield since last year. Staking APY is 23%. ATOM, OSMO, JUNO has all done well for me via passive earning

My stablecoin pool is USDC/USDT on GreenHouseDex 24% APR I wish you every success and lots of luck, that‚Äôs an admirable goal. ü´∂ I guess all of us came in for the same reason. And there are many possibilities. Polkadot is launching Equilibrium, polygon is working faster than ever, avax is hodling up somehow, sol is, apparently, fucked hahah. It all comes down to the perception. And making the right move at the right time Keep at it and don't give up. Financial freedom is closer than you think.

Being active in the crypto space has improved my life in more ways than one and I believe it will continue to do so, for all of us.

I do both HODLING and staking with my crypto assets. The passive income + other benefits I get is really cool and I see this market as an opportunity to accumulate gems that will bounce hard in the bull market.

I don't have much luck with getting in early on projects but I'm hoping my luck will change with FLUID. Aside from the possible price action, FLUID is building a system that will improve liquidity across CeFi and DeFi. This is an ad for Haru invest - I would be skeptical of them for sure. Just remember 99% of crypto was made for the explicit reason of exploiting peoples desperation.",0.9996

Pros and cons will change for every new post. The polkadot ecosystem is insane because it enables L1 interoperability. I don't think people understand the power of that. I love Polkadot and its ecosystem, but I'm not sure why DOT isn't utilized for gas or what the utility of DOT is other than to secure a parachain and the network. I'll look into it more thoroughly myself. Hello all,

I've dabbled in the top 30 cryptocurrencies, and by far Polkadot is the most promising. As you know, the DeFi market is just starting to emerge. I'm not sure how long it will take for institutions and businesses to incorporate Blockchain technology and defi products, certainly once regulation sets in. In fact, it has been happening now with GameStop, Chipotle, and FIFA etc.

However, currently the market is filled with rugpulls, bad fundamentals, and packs security and interoperability. Polkadot aims to solve both security and interoperability, and unlike Cosmos DOT has a more important function. Polka dots algorithm sets the rate of inflation and rewards, and everyone who holds DOT gets a say on the network, and even projects through crowdloans.

Currently most layer ones don't have a layer 0 that provides both security and interoperability, leaving many projects to either be hacked or exploited through bridges. Take advantage of being early, and focus on what will create a decentralized sector of business. Processing speeds do no matter right now, as NFTs are only being used for I'll purposes. These NFT's instead of being digital art, can be used for storing private information for businesses, and provide security through a Blockchain: which is what Polkadot provides and diminishes the possibility of error in security and interoperability. Once parathreads get released, businesses can license a slot for themselves, keeping information stored etc. 

NFT gaming can also start within the ecosystem, if a project gets enough DOT for a crowdloan then they will have enough demand from DOT holders who funded the project and received DOT rewards as well as the projects native token. An inflation rate helps encourage DOT holders to participate in the ecosystem, and stakers help secure the ecosystem.

I must say, after trying many different staking systems of various projects, ADA, AVAX, SOL, LUNA, and even COSMOS. Staking on Polkadot.js may be more technical, but provides compounding interest, and a clear information of what your asset is doing. To add to the fact, staking cycles through different nominators consistently: allowing for further decentralization between validators.

As a cherry on top, Gavin Wood was a former CTO of Ethereum. He developed Solidity, the Ethereum EVM, and the yellow paper of Ethereum. He was an important member to Ethereums success, and is overlooked compared to Vitalik Buterin: who I respect just as much as Gavin Wood. Personally, I hold both Ethereum and DOT as I don't believe in crypto maximalism, and believe they will both help evolve the space entirely.

The thing with crowdloans is the only risk you put in is the risk of opportunity through staking, typically a lock up for a project is 2 years. But with high risk comes high rewards, and if you make the correct choices you will end up with more than what you would have gotten if you had only staked. You can never lose your DOT in a crowdloan.

DOT is undervalued, and projects are being auctioned for a parachain slot as we speak! Once further development comes to these wonderful projects, we will see the power of the community of Polkadot. 

The system is entirely genius, and is one of a kind. It is both impressive tech, and will come to be an excellent investment. If you want to invest into the future, invest into Polkadot where amazing projects in the future will be built up on, and handled through the community. Ikr, will be supporting polkadot all the way. Just stake and forget about it Dot is definitely a good buy right now, right now It's so undervalued. It reminds me of other projects that can boom also, like Helium for example and CCD that can go 10x in the future. So many discounts, but so little money left in my wallet **:(** I was invested in polkadot for almost 2 years, but just late last year I started looking deeper into it's ecosystem including Kusama! The crowdloand system for parachains leases are great and an amazing hunting ground for gems, but even among high level of competitiveness there is a great deal of partnerships done on the space! One great example is how Unique Network and Equilibrium, which were battling at the same time for a parachain on Polkadot (both won a slot) are partnered now! I really can't understand Polkadot's price right now. It looks a huge bargain! The network is growing strong with quality parachains. Smart contracts (Astar Network, Moonbeam), DeFi (Acala Network, Equilibrium), NFT Chain (Unique Network), Infrastructure (Polkadot). It's getting bigger every year. A lot of development is on going on dot and I'm loving it. I'm particularly keeping my eyes locked on Unique Networks' launch on the polkadot ecosystem this weekend. I think it's going to be a big deal as the community is already all hyped up about this.

I'm holding DOT long-term tho. Big dick investors buy DOT. I've never seen a blockchain game that employs DOT. It‚Äôs as dead as the rest. I'm betting on Cosmos to be the next wave among new projects. No one needs to win Parachain auction before deploying on Cosmos and there are a number of top projects like OSMO, JUNO, NGM, CRE, SCRT already built on it. That‚Äôs why I cannot understand how Polkadot can still be so undervalued right now. I make sure to buy DOT and BTC every month I just want to say that it is still a work in progress and has a lot to prove. IMHO, DOT is my best hold. Love the team, love the tech, and the ecosystem is growing at a nice pace, Love everything about it. Indeed so. I recently learned about the upcoming Equilibrium launch, and the platform seems so comprehensive, being better than even AAVE as far as collateral requirements for loans go. Polkadot is yet to shine, and could be one of the surviving chains in the worst case scenario Love to see this. It seems like most coins these days focus on low transaction charges and neglect security. Part of the reason i roll with CCD, I'd be watching out to see how these changes are implemented on polkadot The potentials that lies with Polkadot is quite substantial. That's why I am essentially confident in Railgun's decision to deploy its privacy smart contract on the chain. In general, the ecosystem is very promising and might as well turn out to be one of the top 5 in the next couple of months. I got to understand Polkadot better through my interactions with Equilibrium, another project that won a slot in the auctions that happened few months ago. Super excited about the direction Polkadot is tilting towards",0.9997

0,Where‚Äôs Everyone Staking Their Crypto for Max Rewards?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v1teew/wheres_everyone_staking_their_crypto_for_max/,"Hey everyone, sorry if this has been discussed already, but I‚Äôve been staking with CDC for as long as I can remember, I'm not an active investor in Crypto and I prefer to stake it in exchanges that make a decent APY (Not protocols). Initially, I was staking USDC and received around 12% APR, as my 3-month term comes to an end, it will change to 6%.

I‚Äôve been looking around for other exchanges to safely move my money into. Regarding high APYs, I know [NAGAX](https://invezz.com/news/2022/05/26/nagax-a-crypto-trading-platform-rolls-out-multi-coin-staking-feature/) recently launched their staking service with NGC, [Nexo](https://twitter.com/Nexo) still has high rates, and Celsius has decent percentages.

Just wondering where everyone‚Äôs been parking their money since the CDC incident. Let me know!",81,52,False," Have you heard about Anchor?  Yields 20% on your UST stable coins and it‚Äôs totally safe! Not mine, but I had seen this sheet shared on a previous similar post:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/htmlview In staking NGM on Kepler Chrome extension, APY is 23%.

GREEN on Greenhouse Dex for 30% APR.

PSDN on H2O Data app for 114% APR.

Next month OCEAN will release their single-sided staking program and I will jump on it too. Staking ATOM: 17%, JUNO: 104%, NGM: 23%, OSMO: 65%, SCRT:27% using Keplr browser extension

Staking GREEN on GreenHouseDex 28.89% APR Depends, if you want higher than like 10% you may have to go with a protocol, I'm still using CDC.. You could look into Bybits earn platform, they have a bunch of options. If you like high USDC rates, Voyager is still offering 9%. No lockups or anything like that, just maintain a monthly minimum balance. Their debit card is coming out now and only allows USDC spend, so it lets you save & spend a stablecoin, which is pretty simple. I use RocketPool and im happy with it..Now seems i will even stake my NFT for THOL ,for the first time..got into AngelBlock yesterday, thought it wont go up so dayum fast..minting cost 0.069ETH and some NFTs are sold now for over 10ETH per piece..rarity is best and being early, hope im in luck with the second mint also , thats coming up soon i hope..ppl seem to like their plans in the whitepaper Beefy Finance seems pretty good, although takes a bit more work to set up because it's DeFi.

It uses liquidity pools/pairs mainly, and supports several blockchains.

There are some decent rates, and you can do safer pairs like BTC or ETH to USDC. There are also riskier options at higher rates, but probably buyer beware for those. Not sure you've heard about Spool. It's quite understandable the potential reasons why you may not trust protocols. But what do you think about a protocol that is built by aggregating the top yield generators in such a way that the risks you are concerned about are spread out? I just checked again. There is a middle ware where USDC staking is running at 10% currently and that's what I'm familiar with. Critically assessed the risk models for a long time and I can categorically say that it's worth it, even those it may be lesser than the 12% you were making. I have Rowan staked on Keplr, CTSI staked on Binance. 180% & 40% APR respectively Mostly in stables and waiting to pick up FLD when it hits the market. Doing more staking on Keplr Wallet with ATOM, ROWAN, JUNO, SCRT, OSMO, EVMOS. Recently started staking CTSI on Binance.

The returns are decent for each of these assets. Well I'm using CDC as well and the returns are getting more and more shy! I'm looking for alternatives and DAFI looked interesting but complex as it has synthetic derivatives that would reward you with dtokens. A lot to go down this rabbit hole! I was staking with CDC also, bro. Now I have USDC on Yield, EURx/GBPx on Nexo and I'm staking DAFI on Dafi Protocol. I also have some altcoins like DOT and CAKE on locked staking (120d+) for better rewards. It's on DAFI for me. I get up to 250% plus staking on DAFI protocol. I understand that it's a bear market and prices drop and so do APYs. DAFI got a rewarding system that rewards you more especially for staking long term and through bear times. I prefer POS staking now, most of what I got staked are long term holds (I know I know, holding through a bear marketüò©), but I decided to do a bit of every strategy. 

So I'm mostly staking on the cosmos ecosystem through Keplr wallet, APR differs but very reasonable, SCRT 15%, ATOM 11%, ROWAN 184%, NGM 23% (this by far is the most stable price wise, proud of it).  
I still got other L1 like ProtonXPR staked.

Cons of POS staking is the unbonding period which varies from 14 to 21 days. Hi, have a look at these guys if you are looking to invest your money. They pay out around 8% a month, they use your money to run masternodes. I have a whole write up on them if you are interested‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

I am currently struggling with ETH but this news reminded me that I recently discovered a new platform that offers, among other things, benefits related to the transaction, price, and speed, and one of those platforms is Metis, I will probably try it out.  


A friend of mine who is using Metis also told me that Metis is amazing because it is solving problems that ETH has, such as  
simplicity, scalability also and things like storage, security, and savings. I think that is a perfect solution. It would be great if some of you share your experience with Metis, I've heard only the best things.",11,14,False, No one is using Cardano!  ETH does over a million transactions a day.

It was illegal? Strange, I thought Russia will be first one to legalizes regarding the SWIFT transaction but this is huge news The people who had BTC at the beginning of the war could leave the country quickly without having to be doing long rows to withdraw Fiat money Mass adoption, however it may come to be, is great for all of us. Pretty sure that happened before the invasion It's not a good thing. 

Crypto was unregulated and thus perfectly legal in Ukraine. Now it is the opposite. Given the reputation of the regulatory body that had been given the responsibility to regulate crypto I do not expect that something good comes out of it. 

Restrictions, unenforceable KYC/AML rules and increased risks of CEXes soon blocking Ukrainian accounts are among the outcomes I expect and prepare to. 

Source: I am a Ukrainian developer working in a crypto startup. This is the way. All countries need to do their part and start legalising crypto. Bitcoin & crypto what?? Is Bitcoin not crypto? Lol That big brain, now they‚Äôll tax it lmao LONG mans knows what he's doing lmao. Hopefully Ukranians keep all that donated crypto and invested into something good, not just ape into NFTs as I fear they would. If I were there I'd use my newly gifted cryptos to invest into sol prime as I find there the highest return, but I think most of them will just be buying NFT fr lmaooo Woohoo, this is great! I declare air legalized@! I think that this news is bad because it means that the Ukrainian government is endorsing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. I believe that Bitcoin is a bubble and that it is not a sound investment. I also think that cryptocurrencies are a scam and are not a reliable way to store value. That's great to here!! a lot of token will sure pump. i hope MELOS token too when trading is open. Sweet....I'm ready to visit. Yeah I mean it's an easy read that they found out that when they needed help the world donated everything from Bitcoin and ETH to memecoins like ELON, good on him and I hope this helps Ukraine for sure russia is the next Seems many people there will use crypto exchanges like BFX from now on Slava Ukraini! The domino effect is happening. Soon all governments and companies will get involved in crypto.

I mean look at Boeing, LG and Google, all of which have become part of the Hedera council and hard helping fund the HBAR foundation with grants to improve the Hedera ecosystem I thought this wasn't a new story. It's been legal in the country for a while. Probably I missed something. Let's go. This is why bitcoin and cryptocurrency Is important and more in this dark times. Decentralization is a key factor for moving money without intermediaries like banks, who only know how to screw people. 

The metaverse is also really important for the future and governments will have to get in touch with it. That's why we should be ahead and invest in metaverse projects like Kitty Inu and it's native token $kitty.

I know countries like India are pushing hard against crypto. Other countries like Turkey and Singapore have begun initiating rules and legislations to block it. Some countries like The United States are holding conferences to discuss its implementation. This is all good news, whether it is good or bad. 

If they are stopping crypto, good. It means they are afraid of it and its potential. History has proven that when the people are held back from something, they are most often more so drawn to it with more passion than ever. If they are pushing for it, good.

This will show best at NFT usage. Hear me out here. I know NFTs for now are just images sold without any actual use than just, looking at them. They are already evolving. Some NFTs like the Royal Falcons Club reward users uniquely with a new and innovative system. Other NFTs are being used for ownership claims and proof of singularity.

We have seen over the last ten years that businesses accepting bitcoin isn‚Äôt enough to make people adopt it. Tons of businesses already accept it and don‚Äôt get many customers who use it. Bitcoin will be a great investment asset class and store of value, but there is really no need for it to be directly accepted ‚Äî apps can just convert to local currency at the time of transaction. Id never give them my btc Fuck Lightning Network. Fuck Blockstream. FUCK THAT!! BIG BROTHER WANTS UR BTC!!! HODLLL That story is fake news. These companies haven‚Äôt announced they‚Äôre accepting anything. It‚Äôs announced they can if they want

Shopify has allowed btc payments since 2013, and Dogecoin + Ltc payments since 2014

Nothing about this is new except, that they can accept lightning payments now on Shopify, not that they are.

Once a company announces they‚Äôre accepting btc with lightning payments get excited otherwise this is a completely fake and misleading news headline.

Also there is a 2% fee on the buyers side and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs slippage/spread on strike as well even tho the fanboys will argue there isn‚Äôt, the consumer is looking at atleast a 3% fee.  Good luck disputing a charge  if there‚Äôs an issue on a purchase. Lightning is like a clunky, user unfriendly altcoin, there is no point to it while BTC doesn't have L1 capacity to use it without custodial solutions. So let them move to El Salvador and Honduras and Russia to exploit their customer base! 99% of the people who made it in crypto rose from the ashes of a 3 year bear market, real traders pray for real bear market because it is called shopping time. [deleted] This is stupid. BTC is being integrated directly within ICP, which is a real blockchain with lower fees and faster transactions and less complexity than lightning. Besides, lightning is just a rehash of nostro vostro tech from 1970, it's not a blockchain. People that give up on BTC now might soon feel like the bloke that bought Pizza with 10,000 BTC.

Pros and cons will change for every new post. I see that when bitcoin fans say ""fundamentals"", they mostly mean ""hype"". IMO, ""fundamentals"" should be more equivalent to ""use cases"". And so part of the problem that I see with bitcoin is that many of it's use cases can now be done elsewhere---on other chains, with less volatile assets. For example, the company making the news recently for having one of the largest shares of bitcoin did so because they used BTC as a collateral in a loan. Nowadays, thanks to DeFi, anyone can do the same with less volatile assets (ex: stablecoins). And so, there is less demand for bitcoin. 

In other words, IMO, I see BTC as ""legacy"" technology that is just waiting to be replaced by shinier, new technology. (For any devs out there, BTC is equivalent to jquery :-) ) The most useful thing I've ever seen Bitcoin used for is when a buddy of mine bought psilocybin analogue tabs off some darkweb market back in the day and we tripped balls and had a grand old time.

Now it really is nothing more than an increasingly concentrated speculative investment tool where a few large players can move the market at will, profiting whichever way they happen to swing the market.

I'm sorry, but the ""fundamentals"" of Bitcoin are about as sound as the beads used by early European colonists to ""purchase"" land from the natives.

If every single Bitcoin node and archive got wiped off the face of the planet right now, the only loss anyone would experience would be whatever money they currently have invested in it. Literally nothing else bad would happen, and the world would arguably be a better place for it. bitcoin has no fundamentals and is useless out dated tech lol I'd like to know how much usdt it will cost in a month at least Yes Bitcoin based stock PUTS go brrrrrrrrr No one knows what the bottom will be. DCA can help at this point. Many prices are discounted. I think Bitcoin dominance will continue to increase against altcoins. Might buy some BTC here & diversify to probably gaming/P2E & layer2 alts later. When would the dip end? That's the main question. I was fortunate to sell BTC when it was in the 45k$ range. I've used it all up buying the dip, yet it keeps dipping. Even added some shiryo profits too.

1,"Hype never lasts that long and when its gone, only fundamentals and technology stay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/uqed1c/hype_never_lasts_that_long_and_when_its_gone_only/,"The argument with hype coins and memecoins is always that ‚Äúthey make money‚Äù when in reality if you did make money off of these coins you‚Äôre part of a very lucky few.

99% of people who invested in these coins ended up losing the majority of their investment. And they most likely won‚Äôt be able to get that money back for the fact that these kind of coins rarely ever make it through a bear market cause they rely solely on hype and have zero utility of fundamentals.

Historically, only coins with actual technology backing end end up making it through crashes and dips. Ethereum is great example of that. Also look at projects like Bitdao with with massive backing from their treasury. When you take into consideration that they have the largest treasury in the market and are the 43rd largest ETH holder, its no surprise that their price has been holding up really strong.

Now compare these projects with almost all hype coins and meme coins right now and you‚Äôll see that its not even a competition. These meme coins are down REAL bad and what‚Äôs worse is that they most probably won‚Äôt make it back.

So save yourself the hassle. There‚Äôs no fast and consistent way to make money here. You have to invest in strong fundamentals and technology and wait out for the long term instead of investing in the hype and getting rekt along the way.",12,15,False," Some of the research can be above my head. I put a tiny bit of money in mina, because the sound of the technical description seemed good. I looked at the white paper, but then my eyes rolled back in my head and glossed over and I have no idea whether it is significant or has potential. Similarly, I have polkadot. Do I understand polkadot? No, but it sounds good? It sounds like a thing that's useful? Am I just whining about being too dumb to do due diligence? I don't know. 

What I do know is paying fees to move money around and sitting around waiting for that money to move. In actually using cryptocurrency to do things I do with regular currency - functional things that need doing - I have a great deal of confidence in monero, xlm, and litecoin, because all three work nicely without being punitively expensive or ponderously slow. I haven't even really tried to research them much because I know from dumb experience that when people are going to use cryptocurrency to buy things and send money they are going to want it to work the way those do. Some people know for sure how to invest correctly to earn more usdt in the end Yeah. Investing in fundamentals also comes with being patient. Could remember memes were 10x'ing overnight sometimes in Q1 2021 while FA projects were lagging price-wise.

Next cycle, I'm focusing more on Layer 2s, Gaming guilds/P2Es, Oracles, AI. You'll realize how many people claim that Monero is the only true cryptocurrency. I believe that they are mostly talking from the standpoint that true decentralization is impossible without privacy and ignorantly, they assume privacy is limited to its blockchain. As a matter of fact, I've seen even better innovations regarding privacy on the blockchain. For example, Railgun used zksnarks to build a smart contract on L1 protocol that somehow has the mechanics to work across all chains it deploys. So far, I don't think I've seen a better structured utility in a crypto project I have to agree OP, have an upvote. Since we are in a bear market, (I know that nobody likes hearing that)  we have the opportunity to buy blue chip cryptos like ICP and HBAR and prices no one has ever seen before. We know these projects have budgets of billions of dollars, VC backing, real world partners and hundreds of devs. Does your meme coin have that?

I am very good at not doing stuff. what a load of crap, in bitcoin we trust ultra cringe, did they kick you out of scientology and thats why your here? HODLING is literally the single easiest strategy of all possible strategies. most people struggle with selling and taking profits.

get past your emotion  ... but  simultaneously dont forget to play a bit cult and worship Bitcoin like a deity lmao When dealing with any assets it‚Äôs best to keep emotions out. The only fundamental of Bitcoin worth focusing on is market share. Bitcoin is huge and some argue too big to fail. Other than that? One hour block confirmation time? Huge transaction fees (for small amounts)? 7 transactions per second? If a coin like this came out today, it would be labeled a shitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public dispersed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique in that there are a finite number of them: 21 million.

Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted bitcoin as payment.

The underlying Bitcoin protocol is deflationary because the supply of bitcoins grows at a diminishing rate. The result is that the purchasing power of bitcoins increases over time. Bitcoins may be lost, but they will never be devalued.

Bitcoin is often described Holding is not the best strategically. This is not debatable, it‚Äôs mathematically incorrect. It‚Äôs not even the best safe strategy. It will make you money though.

Holding has never been, and will never be, the best strategy. Not an opinion thing. Pretty easy - Bitcoin is going to $100k - the pattern repeats, everything in between is just noise. Ignore it and HODL. Holding is much more fun when you‚Äôre a miner, keeps growing! [deleted] I would have done way better if I just held my USDC, personally. I sold before the crash got big, then bought in again right before it did‚Ä¶ Hodling is just Hodling not the best strategy

Accumulation of BTC is greater than Hodling Honestly, I struggle with selling, not holding.

Holding is easy, I just throw my ledger out the window. To hodle all you have to do is buy and forget. What‚Äôs so hard about that? Defining local and major tops, taking profits on the way up and estimating the dips to buy back in to accumulate more coin is much harder and too hard for a lot of people because it requires time, knowledge and research. If you really want to HODL get a Nano S and periodically send your BTC to it.  It is just enough of a hassle to transfer it out, but not *too* much of a hassle if you must..

Most alt crypto investments should be shorter investments than many other markets. This is cuz of the cheap valuations VC and ppl get into. This in turn causes lots of sell pressure and volatility in the markets when the project does become successful. So I always recommend to invest for the short term cycles in crypto. That being said, the best thing YOU can do is look at the‚Ä¶ 

(1) Solana ecosystem compared to eth‚Äôs. You‚Äôll see that impressive backing usually means very lackluster price action. Early backers can get in at nutty cheap valuations, only for the token to list at 10x+ the seed Val. This is also accelerated by FTX listing then as Perps, only adding to the sell pressure, as it allows shorting. With funding/backers, it‚Äôs best to look to community projects with little or no VC backing (rmrk, spell, ohm). These coins can do many multiples just because they is no coordinated selling, usually. That being said, each of these coins is down like 80% after going up 100x. This is weak conviction selling coins to greater conviction. This is actually healthy for markets, as there are ppl like me who turn 9k into 300k on spell; quickly becoming a sizable % of my portfolio, thus allowing euphoria to only accelerate the fear or losing riches. Healthy.

2.) don‚Äôt lie to yourself. My biggest mistake was letting others convince me of something. Ofc you gotta have ppl like coin bureau to act as a stepping stone in crypto. However, in peak euphoria and froth, there‚Äôs toxic ppl wanting you to support the next world reserve currency and will hit you with massively flawed logic. My favorite was ohm. If you don‚Äôt know what ohm is, it‚Äôs a treasury-backed asset. If the coin goes below treasury, then ppl could arb it, in theory. The coin traded to 20:1 treasury backing at peak, with dumb money chanting ‚Äúits back!‚Äù

Think about that for a second‚Äî ppl were lining up putting their lifesavings into a project that only ensured a possible -95% drawdown, *IF* the team dissolved the funds to token holders. The team decided to invest that money similar to a VC (decided in November mind you). So now the risk-free treasury is now a risk-on liability. Peaked at 3k, now like $60. Good project honestly, but ppl lied to themselves BIG time.

3.) Knowing the landscape. So for this Ill talk on top L1s. Eth was king in 2020, if you were on another chain, then you missed. That being said, BNB caught massive attn going into 2021. This was due to their grant program or liq. Program (forget what it‚Äôs called). This saw massive liquidity and valuations on a chain with WEAK fundamentals, but cheap fees. This became a narrative. I missed all of this, but I fortunately was a naive matic believer. I saw a Reddit post about getting on the chain and using Quickswap, so I did just that. Bought $500 or so of quick at $20. Got a nice return, but sold a bit early. Matic is fundamentally stronger than BNB, but still weak, especially at the time. Another coin I was big on was Avax. I replicated my quick trade on avax, and bought png cheap. Did my research, learned about subnets and horizontal scaling that other chains like matic cannot do. This built my conviction in avax, so when they announced their liquidity program, I was then able to ride it from ~$20 to $110. Ditched my png for a better dex token (joe) and made a good return on a sizable chunk of my portfolio.

When moving into dapps, it‚Äôs also important to consider landscape, tokenomics, and tech of L1 layer. I‚Äôve moved away from betting on lending, dexs, meme coins on strong chains, and now bet on novel projects building on these layers.

4.) since I invest in cycles, it‚Äôs best to look for hype imo. No one knew what ohm was at launch, but I could have easily have got a 5x out of it just based on how strong the community is. 

Spell and the abra projects had insane projects and potential, BUT I‚Äôm absolutely convinced the convinced it was Dani‚Äôs memes and [shitposting](https://twitter.com/danielesesta/status/1467912789985529863?s=21) that drove hype and community.

Solana has insane marketing and backers. While it‚Äôs ecosystem did absolutely shit, the token itself thrived. This is because of the dynamic for new investor wanting cheap fees and low valuation bags. I never entered with lots of conviction, and I think I‚Äôm actually in the red 5k from sol NFTs lmao.

Avax was hyped cuz of the $600m-1b rewards program.

5.) learn to admit when it‚Äôs over. We‚Äôve seen massive pumps into 90% pullbacks with the majority of those tokens never again reaching half their ath many times in crypto (Ltc). This is why I invest in cycles, because the dynamics change so fast. Many top L1s cannot compete with the next wave of L1s (look into celestia ;), so learn to cut your dreams early before the market does.

5b.) learn Ta. It‚Äôs not voodoo, nor a prediction thing. However, you can learn market structures of what‚Äôs likely to be bullish/bearish based on price action (pa) alone. Ya tracks the markets emotions, and Crypto is nothing but emotions cuz 99.9% of ppl don‚Äôt kno why they‚Äôre buying crypto, they just know number go up. 

I‚Äôm not gonnna larp and act like I sold top. I mainly trade lowcaps, and a brief bear from top coins can be a GREAT entry, but I‚Äôm down like 50% from ath and many great traders are. I grew bearish when btc formed an ascending wedge in the 60ks. I did break structure to 69k, but ultimately slumped back into the wedge. Being a eth head, I watched eth battle BTC‚Äôs negative pa, but it ultimately consolidated just ABOVE 4k support. This shows weak buy pressure, so I exited with an average sell of like 3800-4200. Held my rmrk from $70 to $16 tho lol some are just too strong

[free ta course that I started with](https://youtu.be/q7BVTJol0IA)

6.) all business is done on Twitter. I have my own project and almost only reach out to ppl via Twitter. Telegram and discord are the next most important apps to use.

Reddit is for the pigs, and the pigs go to slaughter. That being said, there are LOTS of big brain ppl on the chats, none of which are the top comment or post.

Twitter ppl:
[cobie- most popular trader](https://twitter.com/cobie?s=21)
[Andre](https://twitter.com/andrecronjetech?s=21) and [banteg](https://twitter.com/bantg?s=21) are devs at yfi
[hentai avenger- turned 20k into nearly 100m](https://twitter.com/hentaiavenger66?s=21)
[CL- cat](https://twitter.com/cl207?s=21)
 
Lastly* follow [DarrenLau](https://twitter.com/darrenlautf?s=21) he has a telegram with all of the crypto news from that day. This is what will turn you into a wolf

6.) fail. And admit your dumb (see my last comment lol)

I was a scared little kid in 2020. I bought the fear of corona, but was hesitant to enter crypto with force in defi summer 2020. 2020, I got a 3x with my money, but suffered a 60% drawdown. I learned Ta and fundamentals going into 2021. From Jan to May I got a 5x with a 50% drawdown, then that summer to present I‚Äôm up 10x AFTER suffering a ~50% drawdown. 

Now as crypto ppl lose more and more hope the lower we go, I‚Äôm gaining more and more hope. The lower we go, the more multiples do do on the next leg up

7.) learn narratives. Ohm fork, gameFi, L1s. This is best done via Twitter and pattern recognition

I spent 5.5yrs in hs and didn‚Äôt graduate college. Now I got a team of writers with way more impressive credentials than myself. I learned more than them because I took the risk and was curious.

Also, someone said day trading is worthless, well they just cannot control emotions. I turned 1.5k into 13k day trading for a month, but it‚Äôs exhausting and boring. I was also using leverage, and that Carrie‚Äôs immense risk. One of my old bosses went from 5m to 250k in a month from leverage. Low caps I think are safer

Hope you enjoyed. I spent like a hour and twenty There isint dude. Just starting capital and time. Everything else is a guess nobody knows anything. For me it‚Äôs all about bankroll and timing. I think trying to day trade is pointless, nobody knows where the price is going in the short term and to make a big score you need to be on leverage anyway. So I just accumulate and hold spot. Watch videos, listen to podcasts, read articles. Most good portfolios have plenty of BTC and ETH in them and I still buy them regularly. I never pump in enough fiat that a big crash would affect me and once you‚Äôve been through several you don‚Äôt really care. I have plenty of alts too and generally don‚Äôt treat my crypto balance as real money, if it grows in the next 2-5 years maybe I‚Äôll cash out and buy a house You need funds to start first, then decide on what you want to be doing; hodling, trading, staking ... But then in anything you are doing always remember to diversify your assets... Even if it means getting a single project like derived finance that makes it easier for you or buying them one after the other.... With this, you are gonna make it ...  Great post! 
 I have been struggling to understand what are the fundamentals to deal with crypto market. 
Been reading about blockchain, listening to podcasts, watching YouTube videos (i don't really trust this one), read the guardian on a daily basis, read crypto news once a day. Idk if I'm doing it totally wrong and I'm not growing how I could be, and i actually feel like even though I know more than I knew a year ago, i still could know way more if I knew what to study, follow, listen, do.

 Serious post right here. If crypto is going anywhere, it needs to be taught and it needs to be adaptable to all kinds of processes of learning Don't do leverage trading
Do spend time developing your strategy
Do automate your strategy with bots
Do all the best to prepare for taxes
Don't stray away from your strategy thinking you know the market
Do have several strategies running engaging the market in different ways
Do tax loss harvesting
Do have several paper trading accounts running different strategies. Data is power
Don't fall for the fomo
Don't fight the market, if the market is the wind, be like grass
Do take profit
Do keep developing strategies
Do brush your teeth

Trust me on the last one Well... in my little knowledge, have a strong capital before investing because you might later sell everything of along the line if the capital is not strong.

Also, invest in projects with strong fundamental which will not fade away when bear hits the market or maybe the project will get you rugged.

If possible in order to get in early to reap the benefit, invest in low market cap projects like I invested in TRIAS, DIA and PNT which are all backed with strong partnerships and has great fundamentals.

Most important thing, make sure you do take profit. That is what I do and it helps me out. The truth is that no one knows what it‚Äôs going to do, so do your research and only invest in ones that you believe will be useful in the future. You will probably need more than a Reddit post to understand the fundamentals of a solid crypto project, but I will try and give a few pointers. Integrity of team, low market cap, vibrance of community, use-case and tokenomics. 

These are few things to need to check. I applied this to Gather Network ($GTH) , AIOZ Network and Basic Attention Token ($BAT). 

$GTH use-case being a blockchain solution to website monetisation to end ads. $AIOZ, decentralized CDN. Don't miss ver expose yourself 

Invest money you don't need in a long time

Don't go chasing the pumps, buy the dip

Don't forget to take profit. Profits not taken is not yours 

Invest in solid FA and active development projects If you place products before every other thing, you‚Äôll likely make the right decision. 
On the long run, projects with good working products will thrive because activities will keep on growing. 
See SPOOL for example. 
Creating a DeFi protocol that allows users diversify into multiple yield aggregators at ease with reduced risk and fees too. 
It‚Äôs a good example of a crypto project with a solid working product Hey mate, interesting topic.

You can research all day, every day, but in crypto, there is no sure thing, just the fact that hodling concrete solid coins will make you some ROI if you hodl long enough. 

I chose one strongest, leading project on every crypto branch, Ocean for WEB3 and DataFI, NGM for stablecoins, etc... and bought as many coins as I could. One of the most important points in my research was the difference from competition and could I imagine this project be here in 5 years from now... First of all you have to do extensive research then filter the noise from the real stuff. Then invest in projects proffering real solutions like Matic, OCEAN, ATOM, SOL, ETH, etc. Buy low, sell high, stake your bags, rinse and repeat. These processes have helped me recently make a big bag, especially with SOL and Cartesi in recent times",0.9996
1,"The fundamental value proposition of cryptocurrency is self-sovereign capital. ‚ÄòNot my keys, not my coins.‚Äô Currently, DAOs take ownership of users‚Äô capital by managing it in a treasury controlled by a few individuals.

This must be very bullish for $SYS. Really excited for this one, I think SYS is opening the door for a new era of DAOs. Hope users can freely use their usdt without any problems I've said it before and I'll say it again: DAOs should adopt Gridlock for their members' funds. 

A non-custodial, decentralized, personal wallet that embraces everything a DAO values. For wallet recovery, there is no intermediary body - just verification from people you trust.

Key-splitting technology which distributes pieces of your private key between you and people you assign to be your Guardians. No one can see your key, not even you! 

A DAO treasury could be distributed across multiple Gridlock wallets and there would be no way anyone can breach them and take the funds.

1,Don‚Äôt go investing in a crypto project if you have no idea about its fundamentals or the technology behind it,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/tc4slc/dont_go_investing_in_a_crypto_project_if_you_have/,"I feel like a large number of people invest in projects without researching what these projects are doing in the market, if they have real utilities, or if they‚Äôre worth investing in on the long term. 

What‚Äôs happening is people get their information from social media platforms, where projects are being heavily marketed, which is a huge mistake since a number of these projects turn out to be rugs. 

And of course, every major scam in the market is slowing down adoption, and giving a reason for new users not to join the crypto space. 

This is why it‚Äôs important to always research a project before investing, because you might stumble upon gems like BIT that gives you access to the BitDAO ecosystem, to invest early in major DeFi and Web3 projects. 

The top projects in the market right now have reached 90% of their potential, and most of the mediocre ones won‚Äôt be around in a year or two, so take your time before you spend a penny on any crypto investment.",5,24,False," [deleted] The importance of doing your own research in the crypto space can't be overemphasized. I invest carefully about the project fundamentals, partnership, and the use case it offers. One of the reasons I got into Sylo is it offers decentralized communication in the space, which is private and secured. They are some launchpad projects that are worth checking out, but the fact remains, most are out of a quick grab not giving a demn about F***k Upscalability and overall demand is what drives a business. Crypto's influence on the world is dominating to say the least. Platforms like poptown that are based on DeFi protocols, have multi chain interoperability, backing by big brands and stellar returns with a strong possibility of getting into NFT‚Äôs and Metaverse will be instrumental in swiping off the myth that crypto is temporary. Once that is established, crypto will be a case study, even a subject ,taught in schools and universities i'm not gonna buy a car since i don't know anything about car technology n anything behind it. But now it's hard for me to walk to wherever  i wanna go! Research is the most important thing we need to do before investing. I don't think people know what to look for before investing or are too lazy to devote time to research. For me, use case, project development, partnerships, DAO activity are some of the things that we should look at.
For example, the DIA oracle project is constantly evolving, and making partnerships in order to provide oracle services. They reward holders who participate in the DAO CAR vote by receiving a unique POAP badge. I agree and that's one mistake a lot folks make, buying into a project without understanding what it actually does. Personally, I do my research by dong dome background checks. For example I only bought into XPRESS recently after discovering it already has a working app with plans to bring onboard so many other updates with time.",0.925
1,Let's find some crypto gems using Fundamental Analysis!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/tg1ysv/lets_find_some_crypto_gems_using_fundamental/,"Hello, while everyone is doing this(in a horrible way), I thought to let's discuss on some low cap gems so that they can have better visibility. Conditions are as below:  


1) Should be low cap sub $30-$100M market cap. This is subjective and not the holy grail, if the project is like good a lower or higher mcap is welcome!

2) Should have solid(verified) partnerships.

3) Super strong team(product, engineering, marketing) with solid credentials(educational background, experience, etc.)

4) Do they really need the blockchain? Couldn't they offer their services without a token?

5) Solid Tokenomics 

Not necessary but good to have: If the project has active user base/active app/active product.

&#x200B;

Let's bring it on!",27,70,False," RBIF is definitely a gem! RBIF it is! Robo inu finance has 25 million market cap. Tokenomics- 10% sales tax ( 3% goes to holders,7% marketing wallet) and a 4% buyers tax ( 1% to holders, 3% to marketing wallet) The development team is the best in the businesses , with Vy leading the charge. She used to be apart of saitama then left to start this project up. RBIF looks solid for 2022, very worth checking out I got rbif. Think it could be the new shib Lol at people posting actual shitcoins underneath this.. Reddit investors When it comes to low cap gems, strong teams, excellent tokeconomics, and partnerships, this is obvious in the use cases of projects like Aave, Cosmos, and Spool, which aim to establish a profit-maximizing and risk-reducing yield platform for Defi aficionados.
It's not a bad idea to have a glance. I will say UPBOTS aside their token  there have many partnership, have trading bots for Dex and Cex, offer staking and referral program as well. Smells like RBIF shills are out and about. I remember when Jasmy shills did the same and it tanked in price shortly after. Same with Akita Inu and other shitcoins. Polyswarm. I'm heavy into RBIF and LRC! XPRESS

1. Less than $5million market cap, 2. partners with binance, polygon, gates io etc, 3. team is good and mostly from India and Europe and having very good history in the space, 4. they are all about bringing crypto utility to people everywhere with the cryptoxpress app, 5. 10million total supply with investors token vested Yes, you are right OP. Similar to what I look out for in a token before investing. Low mcap, team, real usecase and utility. For instance project TXA, have solid team behind, and they offer DSL(Decentralized settlement layer) to exchanges, which is it's real usecase. Then something like UDO, solid team, low mcap and offer crypto payment solutions to users. These are why I'm invested in both project. Any other suggestions of token with all these fundamentals? This is more like a description of the QANX token from the Qanplatform which is the first quantum-resistant ETH-compatible blockchain built by teams of experts with strong professional background from companies and projects including Ethereum, Monero, zCash, Uber, IBM, Telekom. Basically investing in low cap projects can be very profitable for this reasons I look closely into any low cap with fundamental properties and specifically Polkadot low caps have proved beyond all doubts to be a solid investment, I hop on PNODE at its IDO sometime last year and making a ground breaking 2000% was a major hit and still looking to make more wins as time goes by. I can't really speak for others, but I believe RFOX fits this description in my opinion, I've been in the ecosystem for a while, and their community is solid and welcoming, with close partnership with coingecko and ICON, to name a few. And M-cap is around $55M. I think Subsquid satisfies conditions 2 to 4. Their token launch event comes up later this year. MUST is a good gem to bag. Not only does it have one of the best crypto   
and NFT gaming presenter in the name of Jerome as its CEO, it has a   
strong passion for driving and also has a good gaming platform. Catcoin would be my suggestion. It‚Äôs a 15 million MC now with an ATH MC of 70 million. It‚Äôs on a few exchanges LBank and Azbit and it‚Äôs hoping to make that jump to a tier 1 exchange. It‚Äôs community run but the admin all have previous experience with successful crypto projects. There‚Äôs a lot of tokens in circulation but with such a low market cap you buy a lot of tokens for not very much $.  The reflections are probably the best part as you earn money just simply holding Catcoin so you basically get paid to sit back and ride the wave. landshare/mybricksfinance

polygonum/zomfi/undeadblocks

copiosa I completely agree with you because I am a firm believer in strategic partnerships, backers, tokenomics, active communities, and use cases, among other things. This is something I am more interested in, especially when it comes to adding low-cap stocks to my portfolio. Taking these and other factors into account, I recently added some promising low caps such as DKT, NII, CVP, and TOWER. It is always preferable to DYOR. Robo Inu Finance. DYOR. rbif easily",0.998
1,"I want to buy fundamental tokens, what should I buy?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/rzx2fv/i_want_to_buy_fundamental_tokens_what_should_i_buy/,"Hi guys, I am a conservative investor and only stick to fundamental analysis. Therefore, I buy only fundamental projects with prospects for the future. I already have in my investment portfolio: Near, Sol, Dot, Luna. What else should I buy?",68,545,False," You want to buy fundamental tokens but dont have any exposure to BTC or ETH?? Layer 1: Btc, eth, algo, atom, ada.

Layer 2 eth: Link, matic, lrc, dot, the graph

Honorable mentions: xtz, bat, chz, cro, luna

Next to research are near and filecoin. Updog is the most solid new project. So you're a conservative investor who doesn't hold any BTC or ETH? That's not very conservative nor fundamental. Harmony one BTC, ETH, Polygon, Fantom You ask 100 people, you'll get 150 different answers.  Dyor Cosmos and Polygon ALGO I think Near eco will be the next to blow up like Solana, take a good look how fast aurora is growing. Unibright Harmony Protocol omg! No ETH or LINK? Btc xmr eth. That is it. I see people shilling small cap alts which as extremely risky if there is a bear market.  but you said you want fundamentals. Those 3 have been battle tested and won out. Hedera is a project based on a unique design called Hashgraph. Unlike a blockchain, transactions are not bound in any way and the network is only running in the form of these transactions - no waiting on block confirmations etc. 

The unique architecture allows massive scalability: 10,000 tps is the current conservative cap, however in ideal conditions testing has achieved in excess of 500,000 TPS on a single shard. Energy consumption is the lowest for any DLT by KwH according to a study by UCL. The consensus algorithm achieves absolute finality in 3-7 seconds. Bandwidth is incredibly small thanks to the ""gossip about gossip"" protocol, in which each transaction has two hashes, allowing for a sort of meta consensus with state-proofs and timestamps - terrible explanation but hey I tried. 

You can find proofs to confirm that the network is asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant. This is the highest theoretical standard of security for a distributed network.

Fees are pegged to the USD, currently fixed around $0.001. This is because the project is designed with enterprise use in mind

Aside from the technical advantages (which can be confirmed by looking at independent audits published on the protocol, and by going through open review source code) Hedera is far ahead of any other project in terms of enterprise adoption.

It is governed by a council of Industry leaders and top institutions from across the globe, a DAO in the form of a discordant organisation, I'm talking Google, IBM, Boeing, LG, Standard Bank the biggest bank in Africa, the London School of Economics, eftpos who handle essentially the entire debit system of Australia and are actively integrating Hedera, ServiceNow who count 80% of the Fortune 500 as their clients alone. There's about 20 others right now with a similar stature. They're term limited, meeting minutes are published, and each have an equal vote including the developer Swirlds (however Swirlds do retain a permanent council seat). Each of these organisations simply using a crypto would be cause for that community to celebrate, yet they aren't just [planning on] using Hedera, they're actively contributing to the development and widespread adoption of this particular project. Hell, they are Hedera.

I don't have the energy to really go on, done a few too many of these write ups lol, but if I've piqued your interest do your due dilligence and maybe check this explanation of DLT tech in general, and Hedera's specific advantages from the creator, Leemon Baird: https://youtu.be/IjQkag6VOo0

Hedera.com and the Hedera YouTube channel are excellent rabbit holes to learn more that actually provide verification of everything they say - obviously you want a more neutral source but they're a great place to start (hearing from the users who picked Hedera explain why, rather than just the Devs trying to convince anyone and everyone that they're viable) Lots of garbage shilling in here. Just buy btc IOTA, could be the later which all other run on if everything goes to plan SLT for Tokenization ONE!! adoption is happening right now Chainlink (LINK) Link and rndr I consider blue chip crypto. If those go down, we have much bigger problems. Radix XRD. Only project designed to have bottom-up sharding and full parallel transaction handling. I will recommend UBXT, it has potential to pump soon because of the upcoming events that will come soon. Vechain no question. Definitely a long term investment Theta is the way Need more of these kinda posts hbar, dyor and thank me later HBAR If you are already in NEAR, I would recommend some Tokens there like OCT and AURORA Check out HBAR. Prob the most legitimate project in crypto IMO. 

I would also check VGX, which is the native token for the voyager app. owning it gets you in the voyager loyalty program so it has real utility and they are continuing to add more utility behind it. CTSI has strong fundamentals and it‚Äôs more of a low cap, so bigger room for growth. It offers a Linux VM apart of its layer-2 characteristics. This will help onboarding a new wave a developers to the blockchain! Fetch.ai/Fet the best ai project with huge partnerships. Collaborative learning for health care and machine learning. Decentralized ride sharing and delivery apps. Lots of great information on their website and YouTube about there projects. Icon for its BTP, Blockchain transmission protocol, decentralised interprobility between different chains. ""Fundamental"" and no BTC nor ETH. What do you mean by fundamental? In the short term: L2 Scaling Solutions like LRC and Matic

In the longterm: interoperability solutions are going to create trillions in value over the next few decades.

If you like DOT, NEAR, Harmony, ONE, and Algo then you should check out BTP from ICON.

ICON has gotten a bad rap because it got hyped by moonboys like Ian Balina but it is building the only legitimately trustless, decentralized interoperability network in blockchain. All those projects I listed above have partnered with ICON for the BTP and it hasn't even launched yet.

Here's a good article on it: [https://medium.com/helloiconworld/what-is-btp-b1affe6b3bbf](https://medium.com/helloiconworld/what-is-btp-b1affe6b3bbf) Look up InvestAnswers on youtube. You‚Äôll find a lot of in depth research on each project. You should take a chill pill for BreederDAO to launch their token,I believe it's going to make a huge impact for Metaverse because of its usecase.

Breeder Dao will provide high-volume asset production, tailored to specification, for some of the largest guilds in the Metaverse so they can supercharge their play-to-earn economies. ICX.

Partnered with quite a few projects for an interoperability launch. Will be a single portal allowing protocols to bridge with any other connected blockchain and fully decentralized. Interoperability in general will likely lead the trends for crypto this year. Of your projects, both NEAR and DOT are part of the initial blockchains to join the interoperability launch and will all benefit from the launch of the portal. CKB! Nervos Network. BTC, ETH, ALGO forever Polygon FTM, NEAR, ONE, ATOM, AVAX, LUNA are all very promising and have a good narrative for pump continuation Algorand 100% best fundamentals. I think you should buy fundamental tokens for a start. (not a financial advise) NEAR Honestly, if you‚Äôre looking for strictly fundamental coins at this point, best bet would be 60% ETH, 25% BTC, and 15% LTC for best upside potential. If you‚Äôre looking to be even more conservative, then switch % on BTC & ETH ERGO ..,

POW that accepts smart contracts ! 

DYOR SPOOL has good fundamentals, and prospects for the future. 
They‚Äôre creating a system that connects the investor to several yield generators. 
This will aid multiple staking and reduce risk. 
Since you‚Äôre having a diversified portfolio BTC for reserve 
ETH for utility 
EGLD as an alternative to ETH
ORN one ‚Äúexchange‚Äù to link them all 
DAG because blockchain is an outdated tech
COTI and UTK payment platforms 
UOS game distribution and more (THETA to go with)
ALBT the CeFi DeFi link. 
NOIA Web 3.0 
ALEPH because other projects need solutions 
UNO the reinsurance of crypto insurances
FET Auto Economic Agents 
‚Ä¶ 

More? World Mobile wants to connect the 4 billion unconnected people. Payments on the network will be throug the World Mobile Token. It runs on top of the Cardano network.

They have a 10 year plan. And first rolling out in Zanzibar as we speak. They are currently talking to different heads of state to accomplish their goals.

[https://np.reddit.com/r/worldmobile/](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldmobile/) Harmony ONE, JEWEL $BTC and $ETH before you go deeper into the rabbit hole. You should buy SYS and LUXY. They both have solid fundamentals. So you are a fundamental analyst who doesn‚Äôt own ADA, XRP or BNB? Don‚Äôt you ever lie to us again you little bastard SOL and DOT are definitely good picks. Loads of projects are building on it. You should get MATIC and CTSI as well. Cartesi just deployed its Rollups for more developers to start building through Linux. Add Cosmos- ATOM. Already has a working Inter blockchain communication protocol \[IBC\] & will launch Interchain staking too

If you want other narrative plays; check out DREEM- Decentralized & community governed metaverse for virtual online marketplaces.. [removed] Depends on what you're really looking for. But first of all major exposure should be BTC and ETH, they never fail

Then if you got good risk appetite, undervalued but working projects like ROWAN(sifchain), AIOZ, XPR(proton). Not popular choices yet, when they become you'd be way up already. You're off to a good start, LUNA, NEAR and DOT are certainly must haves. Owning ETH and BTC is a good idea too.

Go do some research on OIN (multi-chain stablecoin issunace platform), DREEM (metaverse), GGM (Play to earn), CVX and MATIC. Please look into King Floki V2 Token. Join the telegram. I‚Äôm telling you, won‚Äôt regret it. This is the most fundamentally sound low market cap token on BSC network, from community to team to utilities. Everything is solid. DM me for more info Add L2s such as Matic, OIN, ZKP, CTSI, and Metaverses such as MANA, DREEM, SAND, and AR. They are all fundamentally sound. Solana, Harmony One and Nano Not much fundamentally better than Nano. FUN We have plenty of options, bro. Just some examples: BTC ETH (The kings). SOL, DOT, AVAX, FTM, LINK (Infraestructure). UNI, AAVE (DeFi). AR, SAND, MANA (Web3/Metaverse). DOT is built on Substrate, a true 3rd gen blockchain. If you take a look at recent news on parachains, then you should be not only bullish for DOT but also for future parachains like Unique Network that is going public this week on the 12th. 

Consider also mantaining a cash reserve based on stablecoins staked at some platform like NEXO for EURx/GBPx (12%) or Yield App for USDC (18%). I'm also researching Swiss Borg right now. See what fits you most. Researching about a tokens usually transcend reading their whitepaper. Many projects over-promise and under-deliver. I have seen it happen one too many times. I usually check community and see what the Devs are really doing. 

Projects like Gather Network $GTH and $BAT creating a blockchain solution to monetisation instead of ads had my interest last year. If you are already in NEAR, I would recommend some other solid project that should kick start the bull run of 2022. Feel free the DYOR the uniqueness of SYS blockchain or the cheap minting few of LUXY token üíØüíØ I have my focus on those gaming tokens at the moment and I'm aiming to get into some of them during their IDO. ATLAS is still undervalued at the moment, when the game is finally up and running we will see a parabolic run in this project. I also have ELU on my radar, it is a token of Legends of Elumia and I'm aping into this one during its IDO taking place this Q1. ETH, LINK, DIA Going straight to the point. 

DIA has got so many fundamental reasons I think its a good buy right now.

Firstly, it's an oracle project, and as we all know, this is the year for web3 projects.

Secondly, global searches about the project, this indicates that there might be a lot of whales picking an interest in this project.

Thirdly, the project powers over 26,000 traditional and digital assets.

Lastly, multiple option for staking DIA tokens among so much more. I‚Äôm very bullish on the Polkadot Ecosystem and almost everything that comes out of its very competitive systems appeals me!

I‚Äôm particularly impressed with cross chain NFT project I have been following for a few month now.
 
Long story short, it's a cross-chain/multi-chain NFT project with game changing NFT features, like Programmable NFTs, High Scalability and High Customizability. It's Environmentally conscient (was on COP26 recently), it has a Serious & Dedicated team which can be easily reached through it's Telegram group. Unique aims to Lower the Barriers of Entry for everyone both on the fee level and on the ease of use. It aims to be as user friendly as it can be.

Recently Unique Network secured it‚Äôs parchain on Kusama network through Quartz, and it‚Äôs aiming for it‚Äôs own parachain on Polkadot network which should take place on the first half of this year.

It‚Äôs a very early, hence risky projects but that I find a lot of value in it! OCEAN web3 data economy. Solid FA with long term viability

e-Money (NGM): Issuing different currency based stablecoins that's backed by reserve and bonds. Already issued 5 EU currency pairs

Those are my recommendations You have a very solid portfolio. You can add a low cap gem like PNT which I just recently did. I stake all of it on the eidoo wallet which i think is the absolute best crypto card due to the incentives for its holders. You should take a look at MATIC, ATOM, OCEAN, OSMO, FET. These are fundamentally strong projects. Buy any of Sol, Plug, ada dot eth and enjoy massive outcome Your best bet is PLUG. Buy and stake for otto blockchain premining and earn otto tokens and PLUG. Yield farming made easy. BTC and ETH AMP Token Kadena Bitcoin, Eth, Kda,

PoW is how the system was designed. PoS is anti-crypto. I believe ZIL is one of the most solid ones at this point. since you are already holding DOT, then you can add PINK because of their recent integration with moonriver, one of polkadot side chain. BNB and CRO are good buy too [deleted] Syscoin is on the come up DIKPIK! Look at Railgun and Graviton GET Protocol, the only project who does NFT ticketing and actually has ticketing companies using it and whose average joe customers don't need crypto knowledge as the crypto part happens in the background.


Real world adoption and the best tokenomics I have seen in any project. 


Fundamentals are perfect, only price action lacks. $DCIP. First investment as a service token fully led by community, located on BSC. We invest as a community and every holder receives his share of profit from our community decided investments.

https://www.dcip.finance
r/dcip_finance SDAO it's a AI fedgefund defi project that's only in its first phase of testing $RBIF if you want immediate results from reflections! If you‚Äôre interested in projects with a lot of upward potential check out SYScoin and TRAC (OriginTrail).",0.9999
1,What altcoins have solid fundamentals and will be able to weather the crypto currency bear market?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/sro6li/what_altcoins_have_solid_fundamentals_and_will_be/,"""To begin with, Bitcoin is a true store of value.
When it comes to altcoins that will last, however, you should look for projects with strong use cases, significant partnerships, and a strong leadership team. Keep in mind that you should always conduct your own research, but a great project I've been following is:

VET (VeChain) is a blockchain platform that aims to improve supply chain and business processes. It has enormous growth potential and significant partnerships with companies such as BMW, H&M, Walmart, the Chinese government, and others.

Those who have something that will be actively used, in my opinion. Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, and Injective, for example, are all traded on Binance, Primexbt, Kraken, and other exchanges with high daily trading volumes.

Some new projects like bob eco coin are also worth to look a.t Despite having very different functions, this is a relatively new project on the block that is creating thousands of jobs and declaring war on pollution through the world of Security Tokens. It's also the first time a for-profit social enterprise has been tokenized in the world. Bobcoin is a type of security token that has both equity and assets backing it.

The smart contract platform fundamentals, as well as the low and recycled energy fundamentals, are most likely. Take a look at companies like Solana, Syscoin, AVAX, FTM, CRO, and others.
""",31,18,False," NII

A gem that's capable of powering real-world use cases such as BlockchainGame and DeFi, and has proven to be very efficient when it comes to high throughput, low latency and instant finality. BTC, ETH, ADA, DOT, LINK, MATIC are my best bets. Hedera (HBAR) has my vote. I'm especially convinced about Railgun and its privacy system which is built using zkSNARKS technology on Layer1 protocols. The strength of its utility is amplified by the demands for privacy that will soon reach its peak. 

I believe you'd agree with me that the public blockchain is in dire need of efficient privacy solutions. Railgun comes in style to solve this without any need for Layer 2 or bridges. With a technical analysis of the current state of things, that's a bull. 

RAIL governs it and its fundamentals are vivid enough from the lens of the solutions its protocol delivers. SYS I'll go with SYLO,  because it provides privacy in communication and doesn't store your data, communication is faster and decentralized, and I'm more impressed with the recent integration with Fluf world. I think Pinknode still stands out in the infrastructure niche though it is polkadot focused but has the ability to do more. One or two cex listing with the recently launched pinknode 1.0 product the project should be back on track. Currently for me I'll call

AVAX - cos I think they will grow a lot more. They're positioned really nicely and I think they'll give Sol and BSC a run for their money

Dusk - cos I think they are still very undervalued. They're ranked 319 on Coingecko with so much shitcoins ahead of them it's hard to believe they won't explode to the top 100

Hyperdex - still pretty early for these ones at presale stage but tech is really cool and have a lot of institutional backers waiting to utilize their tech. Super bullish Altcoins that help solve persistent problems in the crypto space such as transaction speed, transaction costs, and scalability are built to weather a bear market.

AVAX, SOL, and most recently NII have strong fundamentals and will survive any bear market. Have you come across $UDO from the enterprise-grade platform - Unido. Unido offers a suite of crypto custody solutions for enterprises and institutions based on a state-of-the-art fragmented private key signing engine, allowing distributed transaction signing at the blockchain level and providing a corporate governance framework over crypto ownership. There are quite a few I'm betting on to survive a bear market. There's; AVAX, DUSK, FTM, ATLAS & SPS (my metaverse plays) and my most recent addition Hyperdex. I hope I'm right with them all though True #crypto will reward you no matter what. The thing is evolving so rapidly. Just like the kickstarter KOLnet which would be the first marketing DEX that would monetize Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) for their services across platforms! It‚Äôs ticker $KOL is going to be a big utility player in future .",0.9958
1,"The market seems to be recovering, what fundamental tokens should I buy?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/si07se/the_market_seems_to_be_recovering_what/,"Hey guys, today Bitcoin rose to 39,000 and it looks like it could go even higher. I would like to know your opinion on which fundamental tokens should I buy? It is desirable that they do not have a very large capitalization. For example $AURORA, $ONE, $OCT.",53,185,False," Looks like it could go higher. To me it looks like another hit to the low would be more likely. Buy whatever you want, it doesn't really matter in the long run right? Take a look at NGM, OCEAN, CARD, DESO...

All of those are solid DeFi projects with great potential for nice ROI mate. Check out Rowan- token of Sifchain; a cross chain dex built on Cosmos. 

DREEM seems promising too- Metaverse project, probably would have its IDO next month. I have a project that is almost my whole portofolio now, its extremely low cap with a real usecase and massive potential. I have written a short summary/dd i can share with you here. In my views this has to be the crypto project with the biggest growth potential from where og currently sits.


Usecase/Tech:
DARA (Immutable DAO) is a dencetralized storage layer built on top of existing IPFS. But DARA is not married to IPFS. The underlying storage structure can be changed from IPFS to a newer tech without affecting projects that are deployed on DARA tech. Enormous advantage and something FileCoin/IPFS can not provide. DARA now saves the entire internet - audio, video, text, graphics. This led to a FACT-CHECK organization building another usecase on DARA tech. 

Decentralized storage layer has endless usecases. The first 2 implemented:

1. Decentralized Journalism - Imagine wiki/journalism/blogging on blockchain so it can not be censored or taken down or tampered! Records proof of copyright. Lets authors convert works into NFTs for licenesing etc. This is already approved by Google app store and is launching in a few days. After its launched the marketing will ramp up. They have hired a crypto marketing agency that is ready to go when its launched in app store.

2. Onchain Dictionary, Bitcoin of Words (Felix) - Technically, this is not a DARA product but it is built on DARA tech by none other than V SYSTEMS & Sunny King (inventor of Proof of Stake -  Vitalik Buterin called Sunny ‚Äúthe single most original altcoin developer out there"") -  what better proof of confidence in DARA tech can you think of? This launched yesterday and you can visit it on saveaword.com

Onchain Dictionary by Sunny King now supports minting words, quotes, texts into NFTs. Far better or unique than those pixelated graphic NFTs that you see spammed everywhere. 

Team:
2 lead devs of privacy coins, Bruce (cofounder of NKN, a top 200 coin), have Gig (crypto journalist with connections),  Sunny King - inventor of Proof of Stake as a partner building on DARA tech. Louie with incredible project management background in tech industry overseeing execution. Oh, and these stars Are doxxed.

DAO Governance:
Gig (founder) is leading for now but when the DAO is fully functional, holders will vote on new features, and even funding new projects with DARA DAO incubation fund.

Price Target:
FileCoin current marketcap is $3B. That gives us a price target of $75!
FileCoin ATH mcap = $21B. That gives us $450+
I expect DARA to land between $150 to $450 at some point.

DARA has:
1. Immediate utility and adoption - 99% of crypto projects (even among top50) have whitepapers, roadmaps but their usecases wont come to fruition for years, if at all. 
2. A+ Team - what other project has likes of Bruce (of Top 200 coin) and Sunny King involved!
3. Multiple usecases and adoption- Two usescases about to be launched, more on the way (like the Fact-Check company)
4. Legit Tokenomics, Binance CEX potentional - no tax, no burn, no funneling of your funds to random suspect wallets; this makes us eligible for CEX like Binance. With advisers/partners like Bruce, Sunny King, bound to happen sooner rather than later. 
5. Both Felix and Dara is approved by Google app store and is ready to launch with the push of a button. Felix has already launched, and Dara is launching in a few days.

Assumptions/Risks:
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention assumptions/risks to my analysis.

Gig (founder) is a visionary and he founded this with a small presale (200 BNB when BNB was $295ish). With that, he has built 2 functioning products and partnered with the likes of Sunny King, V Systems, Fact Check org and so on. 

However, this means smaller marketing wallet with no tax to fund it either. Without sufficient marketing even best products can remain unknown. It's not like DARA has no marketing funds. But Gig decided to hold off on marketing until the products are built. And this is why masses don't know about DARA yet. 

Timeline for Price Targets:
Many coins broke $1B marketcap within a few months of launch. Clearly, there is nothing extraordinary about breaking into billions$ mcap in crypto space. 

Personally, very conservatively, I think we will break minimum $1B marketcap by end of year, meaning $23.8. And we‚Äôll continue until we land between $150-$450.

This is not a finanical advise, just my thoughts. DYOR. Fundamentals tokens are the best to buy at anytime. I‚Äôve got TRIAS, BRKL, PNT, they are low cap and have real use cases that will always back them up in any market condition. I think OPCT is a good pick! It's a private cloud storage token. You can read about it here: opct.io Exciting to see people bullish again, buying more of my CRA and TUS tokens of playcrabada, also getting a good chunk of CTSI tokens for me, a lot of activies coming in Q1 for Cartesi I highly recommend OCEAN. The tech is very solid. Imagine Amazon but for data. That is what OCEAN is. Big institutions are already using it to buy and sell data. Have you come across NII, the utility token of the Nahmii protocol. It is an EVM compatible Layer 2 scaling solution that differentiates by having high throughput, instant finality, low latency, at a low and predictable fees, with the ability to KYC/AML. There are numerous projects in the space with strong fundamentals that you can buy into. SYLO, MATIC, and NII are all excellent projects, but regardless of what you're getting here, it's good you do your own research. If truly you're interested in fundamental tokens, then you should give a check on NII, the utility token of the Nahmii protocol. It is an EVM compatible Layer 2 scaling solution that differentiates by having high throughput, instant finality, low latency, at a low and predictable fees, with the ability to KYC/AML. Personally, I think 2022 will be a rocky year. I am geared towards:  


1. Bitcoin

2. Layer 2 platforms - MATIC, ETH, BNB

3. Gaming - MATIC, SAND, GALA, ATLAS, researching launchpads

4. Cross-chain - DOT

5. Defi/Staking - NEXO, BTR, CAKE I thinks that blockchain tokensns are good choose You want fundamentals? Vechain is trusted enough to be used by global corporations and govts, and has DNV pushing it to their clients as well. Buying $PARAS 
The NEAR NFT marketplace fungible Token from paras.id üòé Prefer $Aurora, it fell too much, if it will start recover it will be a lot of X) For inyraday trade, okay, but this is going down again soon, be careful. Luna seems like a pretty good fucking deal right now. I bought some. I have a pretty large diversified holdings! But if you are looking for lowcap (hopefuly) gems, and can share a few of my convictions on two of the areas I‚Äôm more bullish about: defi and NFTs

NFT - Unique network, a great bet as a cross chain marketplace and customisable NFT infrastructure creator. I believe it‚Äôs infrastructure will be very important for the next gen of crypto games and on defi connection to web3

Defi - a very competitive and (IMO) very undervalued defi protocol that is like at 90% discount from ATM, which I personally use and gives competitive returns on stable coins and HUGE ones (12%) on BTC and ETH. I believe both the token and the platform are good investment vehicles.

2 in 1 - Kalmar is a DeFi hub, where you can farm (with leverage), lend, raise funds, collect NFTs and soon swap asset. It has an NFT fundraising feature that can be compared to a kickstarter and a cool incubator You should look at what Archangel is building.  A collaborative ecosystem of tokens that will provide user centric solutions for everyone. Unido, in my opinion, is currently a good investment. It is about to debut its enterprise platform, which will serve both institutional and retail clients. While launching the platform, it will offer a staking pool with juicy APY. LUNA BTC at 39k, we love it, but don't  make your judgement only based on that. The biz sentiment has not fully changed and we haven't hit the dip yet. Moreover, I got some PAYB bags at the start of the bear. You know, low MCAP coins are quite a solid option now. It's very undervalued and backed  by a thrilling project. It fits what you want, you might wanna check it. Not trying to get you hyped or anything but you prolly want to take a look at gaming nfts like Mecha Morphing and the Legends of Elumia.

Mecha Morphing will have its IDO soon. It already got its test net rolled out with bugs currently being fixed. Test net II and then IDO before the main net launch. 

Again, nothing to be hype about, but if Thetan Arena did a 124x, hopefully, Mecha will do something close or much higher. Parsiq $PRQ it does everything Chainlink does and a lot more but Chainlink is worth around $10billion and Parsiq $60million. They have paying customers and a team of highly experienced people running it. 

‚ÄúPARSIQ aims to become the go-to enabler of widespread adoption of blockchain technologies, by giving everyone the ability to understand and manipulate blockchain data streams across different mediums and infrastructures.‚Äù

Mission ‚Äì How we achieve our vision

‚ÄúTo develop complete ecosystems of technologies that coordinate developments of trustless data exchange protocols, to enable better harnessing and utilisation of blockchain data in both crypto and mainstream business uses. We shall act as the fundamental bridge between and within WEB2 and WEB3, by providing data processing, interoperability, and automation while reducing costs and complexities.‚Äù

Parsiq is going to blow up this year and really is a low Mcap gem. Undervalued L1s, especially the IBC gang. AIOZ is next up there. XPR too (not XRP). ROWAN also with super profitable pools and looking quite bottomed. Anyone else here on board with saitama? They are releasing a swap this week that'll be half the price of uniswap etc.

Hyper burn incoming so it's gonna rocket hopefully NAV has a stupid low market cap for what it brings.

- Trustless private protocol
- Community fund 
- Staking without a minimum requirement
- Bridges to ETH and BSC
- Upcoming private NFT's and customisable tokens. I suggest you add the DIA oracle token. It has made partnerships with Aurora. DIA is pulling and aggregating trade data from the market running on Aurora.

In my opinion, it has great potential, with a wide range of partnerships and listing on Coinbase and Huobi recently, it is really good purchase. Dead cat bounce imo. Only time will tell tho. Mobie Network $MBX It is still early to say the market looks higher but we never know what will happen next maybe it is a start for bull run.

During the massive dips, I've stacked up pretty well as I await the bull run. Bought AIGO, DIA, BRKL and SCLP which all look promising. Try out SAVG. Everything in its background workings indicates that it's a very solid project to ape into. It's got almost everything you'll ever look for in an NFT Marketplace. Carbon neutral, low minting fees with 98% payouts! The marketplace will launch very soon and you can imagine what that will mean to SAVG holders Its always better to be in the game and never go into hibernation.the damn thing changes every second.Instead, i would rent out all bots from upbots at different times and watch the magic unfold .Their performance stats are life-altering even during dips, which imo is outstanding!! I'm buying UDO in this dip, I don't know about you The market is still recovering and there are very few projects on green right now. I am not panicking anyways because this is best time to bag solid projects. Even $BNB is about half its ATH. 

I am bagging Gather Network ($GTH), $UNO, $DAFI, etc. Gather Network is creating a blockchain solution to end ads, this is definitely the darkest hour before the dawn(moon). Well . Don‚Äôt take my word for it since I own most of this and I‚Äôm a nub when it come to crypto . But I just look at the lifetime of how the coin goes up in value and here what I seen :

Ada
Doge
Algo
Atom
.  Good luck guys . Why is the market going up? What has changed? Checkout MANY WORLDS, dynamic tokenomics where you can have multiple of the same token but have different intrinsic values based on it's level. First ever Token leveling system. Working on software to license out for easier fiat to crypto where $MANY is governing token People need to look into ankr its becoming ground zero for new projects as well as increasing cross blockchain connectivity ETH, SOL, ATOM, LUNA, ONE, FTM, MATIC ada cardano is the best of all not so fast, invest with caution Looking at what happened yesterday shows that there is still hope for some bullish run this year. ETH is actually one of the best to hold and look at some other ones with good fundamentals. I stacked some more NII during the dip, a layer 2 scaling solutions that will at the end of the day thrive once more project gets onboarded on its ecosystem Chainlink. For $17 it‚Äôs a fucking steal for a coin that was reaching heights of $40+ pre-crash. Check out Wootrade and their token Woo. The roadmap is coming out soon. Ankr - great coin that is going to explode in the next 12 / 24 months. I like NKN also You should of been buying at the floor. 
Why wait til now Hard to say. You need to see what you like, what fundamentals you want. Ocean Protocol is a very good data project with important partnerships, eMoney is the most likely to succeed in stablecoins, WAX is super good for nfts etc etc I think we will double bottom back down towards 32k then move upwards towards 80k If you like looking for upcoming projects maybe

r/Insert_Stonks might interest you solid project with a solid plan for the near future that can real advancement and continuous development of their project. r/Insert_Stonks bridges the gap between gamers, game developers, and the crypto space with the Stonk Engine and Stonk Chain. You can read their project in their whitepaper posted on their website. #insertstonk


https://www.insertstonks.com/ MINA is still cheap for its potential. i have dafi gth aioz and ftm in my sights. will look to dca in them in dips Buy JUNO and stake it.

Thank me in 2023. DCA into it whatever you do.. buy gradually.. this is probably a bull trap I'm buying more DOT, OCEAN, DYDX, ATOM, NGM, OSMO, JUNO

Got some metaverse tokens GALA, TLM, TVK and RarioCricket NFTs. You can give a check on Polkadot or some fundamentals like Unido with crypto banking and asset management platform built on the Polkadot ecosystem. I'm investing more into metaverse and privacy related low caps. I currently hold BLOK, SPDR, SCRT and TRIAS. The market is recovering and this might kickstart another bull run. 

Picking up some low-capped projects with good fundamentals and active community is a no-brainer.

NII is one of the leading layer scaling solutions for Ethereum providing instant finality and predictable fees. It's now at 41k and the bulls night just be back. I would strongly advice to buy strong projects like ATOM, JUNO, AVAX and Cartesi that have potentials both in the short and long term. Shib. Great community, metaverse, Defi, nft, gaming. It‚Äôs a developing decentralised ecosystem that‚Äôs moved on from its meme origins. The gains could be life changing for little contribution. I‚Äôm a bitcoin supporter, think it is sound money that is and will revolutionise the world, however with shib I saw massive potential in this project and I‚Äôve made a lot of money from it. Put in ¬£20 bucks and sit tight for a few years.

- too lazy to DYOR

1,Fundamental tokens in a bear market.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/sq5stt/fundamental_tokens_in_a_bear_market/,"Hi everyone, I would like to discuss with you what will happen to fundamental projects in a bear market, survive to the next bull market or never grow to their ATH again.

I'm interested in hearing your opinion on what will happen to fundamental tokens during and after a bear market.

Personally, my opinion is that fundamental projects will be able to survive the correction, and will show new ATH, as for example it was with Ethereum. Especially in my opinion, those tokens that received additional investments from the largest venture capital funds, such as NEAR (recently received an additional $150M from the largest venture capital funds), and MATIC (Recently received $400M from Sequoia) will recover well and show excellent growth after the bear market.",18,20,False," First off, 
Please define what you think a "" Fundamental token "" is .
As for bear market .
Bear markets wear you down . In Order to get through them you need to just stick to your investing plan and act as the turtle by just methodically moving forward in a slow even pace .
Some call that DCA and others have their own methods . For market timers the best thing to do would be to move into cash/stables and then buy close to the bottom! But most people fail at it!

Good projects will almost always survive! And new bill market will come!

My take is to make passive returns on my holdings either staking or defi! I have been really interested in the BSC defi space as the fees are low and the gains aren‚Äôt worse than the ones on the ETH ecosystem! Pancake swap has the size and liquidity for great moves for much bigger fish than me! There are great aggregators to make the LP life easy! Defi is getting easier, which is great! I think we can be careful and hold our assets 50\\50 stablecoins and something like NEAR There is a saying in the traditional finance world: ""The markets will always bounce back."" This is true and proven.   
And this is (hopefully) also true for the crypto market. We will see. I think that is stablecoin)))) Well said, fundamental tokens survival depends on the team. A good dev team with real use cases. This is what I look for during research and came across one that meets this criteria recently, payb. Any one bought it? Buying during market downturns has been a successful strategy for me; basically, I buy more when the market is down, especially in promising low-cap stocks like PKR, CVP, and TOWER. My most recent addition to my portfolio is PKR, which I also staked on the BSC network for a 20% APY. If by ""Fundamental tokens'' you mean good projects, then you might be onto something. In bear markets, we all know that there's a price downturn, so sometimes it is projects that have solutions for real issues unrelated to market price that eventually survive bear markets. Currently have Subsquid on my watchlist. They provide blockchain data indexing solutions for growing list of other projects.",0.9973
1,"Is it worth keeping your entire deposit in stablecoins now, or is it better to be in fundamental coins that are in staking?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/rb053w/is_it_worth_keeping_your_entire_deposit_in/,"Hi, the market has dropped very much recently, and it is not known where it will move tomorrow, I have almost all the deposit in fundamental coins that are staking ($ ADA, $ NEAR, $ AVAX, $ SOL), and to be honest, I  I don‚Äôt know what to do, is it worth keeping them, or translating them all?  deposit in stable coins.  I believe very strongly in these projects, and I know that they will be very expensive, but the fact that Bitcoin is falling may prevent this.",71,118,False," I mean, basically you're asking if your coins will beat the dollar, ie, rise or fall in the next couple of months.

Nobody knows man!  And anyone that does, is just guessing.  :-) I don't understand the purpose of stable coins. Why not not just keep it in dollars til everything his the lowest you think it will go then buy back in. ADA is down 50% over the last 3 months and is trending down. How is that considered a stable coin or good investment in any world? That's the dilemma most of us are in, no one truly knows what will happen next but imo the best way to go about it is to split the funds into stablecoins and fundamentals projects.

Better still you have the option to stake or farm with the stabelcoins depending on what you choose. You can check out EEUR/OSMO stablecoin pool on Osmosis Dex. The current APR is 20% which is more than ideal.

If you have interest in investing in fundamentally strong projects, you should consider the likes of ETH, BNB, LINK, OCEAN, DOT, ATOM, SAND, OSMO, MATIC, etc. it depends if you've lower entries in coins like which have done 5x or more n you're holding, then you can book some profits have stables deposit in LP or vaults & rest coins stake it if you believe in the project.  


APY will be lower in most the places, but some projects have very good APY like NEAR (11%), ATOM(12%).  
also for NEAR personally I'm doing this, stake NEAR in Metapool > get stNEAR > farm those in ref finance so Staking + Farming at a time with single asset hehe.. Swap them all for Algorand and get passive staking rewards instead on the greenest blockchain ever. Everyone just goes to them for the best staking rewards because thats what the traders want, non volatile liquidity. It sometimes feels like people chasing a high or the dragon. They don't care about the coin, they just want the highest staking reward. Yield is an extremely popular investment desire because it's very easy to judge risk most of the time. Imo the biggest risk is the actual stablecoin you are using, then second the platform that lends it out, because they are the gatekeepers to give you your coin. as long as its not chinese-bond-backed tether i think ur okay either way. tho i personally invest in growth. 

idle money is wasted money, friend It's fine to be in fundamental projects that have good staking returns as long as you don't overexpose yourself in terms of what you're willing to lose. I am comfortable staking my PNT alongside holding. NEAR and AVAX are both good coins for staking.  I'm also currently staking DVDX on Unifarm. I personally prefer projects with good fundamentals and staking I think that's totally up to you. Since you got stake-able coins, why not make more money with them regardless of whether the market rallies or plunges. That's what I would do. And then the none stake-able coins I hodl, I just buy more in dips to cover for losses. The same way I recently bought DIA.

It's all a matter of choice anyway. Good luck with whatever decision you make. Dips are temporary, staked coins are not(unless rugpull), I'd rather stake and accumulate (than have to throw more fiat into) more coins i believe will be worth alot more in 5/10 years than be stationary It's good to have 30% of your portfolio in stable coins at all times. That's what works for me, aside just holding I can also stake USDC on BlockBank app for 10% APY. If you believe in them, then by all means keep them! It will be a bumpy ride, but long term they will definitely produce more gains than the stable coins. I also have PNT in staking (10,5% APY for staking and voting in the DAO) along with MATIC and DOT (staking in Crypto . com for 10% APY). Conservative APY but very sustainable, so safer I guess‚Ä¶ But in 1 year all coins will surely increase in value, especially PNT that right now sits at a market cap of only $33M. I use these staking options more like a store of value - what bank would give you a 10% just by holding your assets?! From my point of view, the best way is to diversify, take some stablecoins for stability, some alts for staking, and some NFTs as they are the new trend and have a big chance in nice ROI, especially sport ones. 

Staking of NGM for me is the best option because e-money project is strong, with real usability in general population and its stablecoins for European market is fully backed by fiat money and government bonds. 

For sports NFTs take a look at Rario marketplace of cricket NFTs. Those NFTs behaves real nicely on market, making nice profits, up to x100 for some of them in couple of days. u can get about 20% APY in anchor protocol if u stake ust Stable coins. Wait for a bottom of the range which I assume will be at $40K and buy based on fundamentals. If I were you, I would completely sell the cardano. I do not expect anything good from this coin. SOL I think will also be much lower than the current values. I haven‚Äôt heard anything about AVAX. NEAR on good values, with a drawdown of bitcoin, I do not think that it will fall much less than $5, but it can grow very well if market will be grow. I‚Äôve never had to stake stablecoins myself. I stake CTSI on Binance for 65%APY and up to 70% on other staking pools. I also have some SOL, CAKE and ZIL on Binance as well. Keep your funds in a stablecoin related project that hedge against volatility. Project like GSD from Gold Standard DAO. It depends on what are you hoping to achieve. 

If you are happy with the amount of money your coins are worth, you should keep it in stablecoins like EEUR who is fully backed by bank deposits in fiat money and government bonds. 

If you want to earn some more money on crypto, you need to make peace with dips like this and wait for market to go up. Choice is on you my friend. :) Stake ADA You can stake stable coins. It's the safest way to make money in crypto. In my opinion I would prefer buying fundamentally solid coins,just like $PULSE.i'm just waiting for this gem to Launch on polkadot.

Pulsenetwork aims to become the leading provider of AI enhanced medical care. Both are fantastic. Just keep in mind that staking stablecoins is a good way to avoid market volatility, especially during a dip. Furthermore, if you look closely, you will notice that some stablecoin platforms provide far higher APY than the fundamental coins. There is almost no ‚Äúone fits all‚Äù or totally correct or wrong answer about crypto investment, the answer is always ‚Äúit depends‚Äù. That‚Äôs the pure truth. Some new elements or factors could make the difference for everyone one. 

Hodling stable coins like USDT, rUSD, BUSD has never been a bad idea in terms of store of value. Whats better is that RAMP Protocol lets you earn stable coins (rUSD) on your collateralized assets while lending at low interest. Tired of Shit/MemeCoins? ..

I propose some diversification, put some in strong projects like BTC and ETH, some in altcoins that you think may have a promising future, and the rest in some NFTs...

Important for NFTs is to get them on licensed marketplaces like Top Shots for NBA or Rario for cricket, so you really own what you pay. It's always important to have some stablecoins on the side. I do it in case of crashes so I can buy at discounted prices. I usually keep BUSD or eEUR from eMoney on the side for this. i deployed most of my stables to buy the dip as of now. AIOZ RAMP DAFI FTM PSP and some more. i am all in. Why not consider both? I prefer to diversify, it puts me in a preferable condition in case of eventualities.

Investing in stablecoins as well as projects with great utility and fundamental is a nice idea. BTC,ETH,DOT are projects with nice fundamentals for the future.

NEAR and PNT are good for staking. I also consider staking DIA on binance one of these days, as there is opportunity to generate yield with DIA tokens.

DYOR and decide what's best for you. No one knows what's going to happen in the next few months but it's always advisable to stay in stablecoins to be able to DCA your positions if the market keeps dipping. Some stablecoin like EEUR is interest bearing as well so you can also earn from them while waiting for market recovery One very nice and stable project for staking is Ocean Protocol. 

You can stake Ocean tokens and get nice APY, plus airdrops of H2O tokens and some more tokens developed on Ocean project. 

Plus it has a great future in DeFi, on data sharing via blockchain. Using upbots to do all my staking and trading. It is an amazing platform which offers you to use bots instead of manual trading. I tried it and i can say that i'm not into manual trading anymore! Using bots to trade ever since ! now, that being said, using the eth bot i made much more than the bitcoin jump. I can say this because i have both. In comparison to an average trader, i made 13x using the bot when eth jumped recently. Both coins are for long term for sure but i'll be betting more on Eth. The last part of your question has the answers, as long as you trust the project man, just delegate your tokens long term, i am highly considering buying a small SCLP bag and staking it for 4 years, up to 200% APY, i have my DOT staked too, ADA as stable as it's been is also staked on Yoroi wallet. Stake and come back after a year! Well staking the coins might be quite rewarding in my opinion especially taking into context how passive income is important in building wealth.   
Also with the developments going on in the DeFi industry like Protocol helping you manage your risk and increasing your rewards by giving you access to several yield aggregators like SPOOL is doing. It‚Äôs good to keep a decent amount of your portfolio in stable coins. 
You can as well stake ‚Äòem on unifarm. 
I recently staked dvdx on cohort25. With a APY of 250% Crypto decisions on what and how much to bag is often determined by multiple factors. 

Whether or not your entire deposit should be in  stable or fundamental coins can be determined by how much the entire deposit is and what fundamental coin we are talking about.

Much better, staking in DeFi has been attractive and its a reliable way to earn passively in the crypto space. YLD and DAFI has very interesting offers with DAFI offering up to 157% APY on Matic Network. It is an ideal thing to have about 60% of your funds in stable coins. That way you can easily earn an extra income staking on LPs just like I enjoy a humble and decent 15 - 21% APY staking PINK on dot finance DeFi yield aggregator. I personally think there should be some diversification.  Although projects like NEAR are absolutely brilliant for staking, their partners like DEIP as well as other web 3 projects like ANKR are a good choice. There are also stablecoins like DUA that may seem like an option",0.9999

While other projects have made themselves a stable value, and only subject to increase in the future. For example, Ethereum and Polygon are doing that.

Bitcoin and Ethereum should be the benchmarks against how you measure every crypto project on the market.

Investing in crypto without understanding the fundamentals of BTC and ETH is like trying to select the best players on a college basketball team without ever having watched or studied Jordan, Kobe, or Lebron play basketball.  How will you know when you've seen the best if you have nothing to compare it to?

Once you understand why BTC and ETH have dominated the market you will be able to quickly separate the shit coins from the projects that have staying power and will generate consistent wealth. >I don't understand why even institutionals are running for it when you look at the other projects who are fundamentaly way better. 

Institutions have other needs and interests than retail investors. They want to minimize risk, and they need liquidity. BTC is the safe bet for them. 

>Such a man like Elon Musk prefered to pump a shitcoin than real and strong project and now every shitcoins pumped.

Elon loves shitcoins because he wants to be the face of whatever he touches. He can't have that with btc/ eth. He can however take a shitcoin under his wing and then pat himself on the back when it surges. ""Ah the little people love me, but I love myself more"". There‚Äôs a lot to unpack here.

> Bitcoin only is the first but in reality it's such an old fashioned with high fees, pollution and very slow coin.
>
> I don't understand why even institutionals are running for it when you look at the other projects who are fundamentaly way better. 

First of all, let‚Äôs make it clear what institutions are looking for: MONEY. You know what type of money? SAFE RELIABLE MONEY. They‚Äôre not doing it to pioneer technology, or improve people‚Äôs lives. They‚Äôre not angel investors that would even talk to a startup. They are powerful groups with millions and more to invest, and they expect millions back every time. No rug pulls, no shitty startups, MINIMAL RISK.

You know what‚Äôs minimal risk? Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its profits are as safe as cryptocurrency can get, and still pretty damn profitable.

For context, I‚Äôd strongly recommending reading [this old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/neg9fg/1k_invested_into_the_top_10_cryptos_on_january/). I‚Äôm serious, it‚Äôs worth it.

Key takeaways:

0. Bitcoin and Ethereum have consistent moderate profits and have consistent rankings.
1. Very few altcoins actually stay at the top for multiple years in a row. 
2. Diversifying across many cryptocurrencies usually results in less profit than investing in the safest ones only. This is because while one or two will go to the moon, the rest tend to grow even slower than the safest picks.
And I‚Äôll add one of my own: 
3. Very few altcoins are even old enough to have a track record of good profits.

In the past 4 years (according to that linked post), the S&P 500 (the safest traditional finance investment) went up ~40%, Bitcoin went up ~600%, and Ethereum went up ~1200%. These ‚Äúold fashioned‚Äù coins are goddamn money-making machines and incredibly reliable in this volatile industry. 

To gamble on a few altcoins would be as risky as picking stocks (a monkey throwing darts [makes better predictions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2012/12/20/any-monkey-can-beat-the-market/?sh=561c9b1a630a) than the most studious humans). To gamble on many altcoins is to reduce overall profits less than investing in BTC+ETH alone could‚Äôve done (and you can‚Äôt count on finding a jackpot ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù coin). 

By elimination, there‚Äôs only one answer: if you seriously want to avoid losses, just stick with Bitcoin and Ethereum.

> Such a man like Elon Musk prefered to pump a shitcoin than real and strong project and now every shitcoins pumped.

You‚Äôre projecting. Not everyone cares about the stats, the technology, the usefulness like you do (you know: fundamentals, so normal people like us can avoid losing everything). But that‚Äôs not how big names or big banks think (or people who don‚Äôt like to research). Some just care about making money at any cost (including through market manipulation) or branding (getting everyone to know your name is a win for various reasons too) or memes.

> I'm in crypto only since 6 months but all the logical choices I made made for my investments made me lose money while I saw so many stupid shit skyrocketing. 

Your logic is either flawed, or you‚Äôre basing it on incomplete information. Like‚Ä¶ maybe the markets are not about logic?

Pretty much all marketplaces (whether local, stock, or crypto) experience price fluctuation as a response to changes in peoples‚Äô (and millionaires‚Äô) emotions rather than their logic.  I mean, they‚Äôre the ones buying and selling, affecting prices. Why do they *feel* like buying or selling when they do? That‚Äôs uh‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs complicated to answer. I would start [here](https://youtu.be/8a0LGCMrjAA) and [here](https://youtu.be/I2D-fvxPkuY) on learning how crypto pricing actually works (both are about BTC but most principals apply to all coins), then when you‚Äôd like to come back to a world of logic, [here](https://youtu.be/lW3eWIj3Q04). (Yeah, I‚Äôm just shilling my fav YT educator)

> I seriously am thinking about cutting at loss my positions only because I'm tired of this ilogical market even if I'm at -50%. 

You‚Äôre about to make an emotional sale because other people‚Äôs emotional sales have upset you? WELCOME TO CRYPTO!! üéâ

> Am I alone or will I do a a real bad choice ?

You‚Äôre not alone.

We‚Äôve all made choices that resulted in lost money.

We‚Äôve all panicked sold (or been very very tempted to).

And no judgment from me either way.

If you really want to bail on crypto, I‚Äôd just walk away. Forget about it. Consider the money lost, you weren‚Äôt expecting the money back fast anyway (right??). Then when the news says ‚ÄúBitcoin hits $100k‚Äù and has lifted the entire crypto market up, go withdraw.

Or if you‚Äôd like, immerse yourself in this space‚Äôs knowledge more deeply than before. Get educated. Learn how markets move. In the end, we‚Äôre really all just guessing ‚Ä¶ but the more educated your guess, the better things work your way. Because reasonable logic will never apply to real world markets, you have to educate yourself. 

Or just buy BTC+ETH and forget about it til it‚Äôs time to retire. Statistically, that‚Äôs gonna make more profit than anger selling, and save you way more emotional energy rather than gambling on altcoins in an emotion-based market. Just when you think you found a project with potential and real use case you invest and it dumps 40%. Almost nothing in crypto makes sense, I said ALMOST. Most of crypto investing is like gambling unless you choose BTC or ETH, why? Because they have been around the longest and are trusted, people are afraid to move away from both of them.  Until the masses choose a different master warranted or not BTC and ETH will always be on top. Every other coin is currently fighting for third place and people with to much money are throwing it at everything hoping to hit 1000% there is more greed in this market than reason. Put 1k in 15 to 20 coins and call it a day,  come back in 4 years. What coins do you consider better then Btc Eth & doge I'm guessing you are an HBAR or ALGO person. > **old fashioned**

The theorem of Pythagoras is over 2500 years old. Is it old fashioned? Do you have a better or more correct alternative in mind?

> **high fees**

Base-layer fees represent the competition for space (bytes) in a data block of limited size. Making this block larger would come with a lot of issues, such as increased centralization.

Therefore, users are advised to switch to lightning, i.e. the second layer, for small transactions.

> **slow coin**

The base layer cannot be simultaneously fast, decentralized, and cheap. Again, you can use lightning, if you want speed (instant payments) and much lower transaction fees.

> **other projects are fundamentally much better**

Which coin would be fundamentally much better, for what reason, and according to what criteria? Please, justify that claim. There are no better solutions. There are just People pretending there are better solutions. Wasn‚Äôt true in 2015 isn‚Äôt true today. With the merge to proof of stake coming, don‚Äôt sell your ETH. 
I would agree with the illogical ways people invest though. Most people don‚Äôt understand fundamentals. It‚Äôs still early and you probably know more than 90 % of investors.",0.9987

1,Which tokens will bounce back the most?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/vbq118/which_tokens_will_bounce_back_the_most/,I honestly think both AVAX and SOL will bounce back huge once things clear up. And of cource BTC and ETH,4,33,False," SOL should use this time with reduced pressure to fix their broken chain, I had high hopes with that one. Still do.

I'm willing to bet that cosmos eco projects too will bounce back as they're majorly L1s themselves, and actively developing. Can easily see dev activities with ATOM, SCRT, NGM, EVMOS. Proposals flying in too.

However, anyone thinking this bounce will be swift should tone down expectations for their own sake. I‚Äôd assume Ada will bounce back also It‚Äôs almost all junk, people are starting to realize that. There isn‚Äôt going to be a bounce back anytime soon. Probably not for another year We will see, for now I see ADA,DOT and BTC as winners, mainly because people seek quality, security and stability. There were just too many fuck ups like Celsius and Luna, and suddenly nobody cares whether your transaction is 0,1 second faster and a cent cheaper, or whether you get some unsustainable high apr. Those projects have the cleanest track record in top 10-20.

I think SOL and AVAX might survive and do fine, but I would lean more towards SOL, because despite many screw ups there is still some good and innovative engineering, while AVAX is just too much ETH copy paste, with fees spikes and similar problems, and bad staking model Tokens with strong fundamentals and utilities like BIT, since BIT holders have voting power over project proposals on BitDAO's open platform, and the opportunity to invest early in the next big thing in Web3 I think everything will bounce back alike. I took yesterday‚Äôs opportunity to increase my stake in AIOZ, NGM and CARD. 

NGM is featuring a wide range of government-backed stablecoins like EEUR, ENOK, ECHF,etc, some of which are already listed on exchanges. 

Taking long term positions on these trio, I‚Äôm happy to stake and earn passively as well. Depends on bitcoin movement, I'm not sure we're out of the woods yet. Though EVMOS is already bouncing back, and it's really impressive as it's not on a major CEX. Likes of CTSI is up 12%, VRA at 7%. I think these are some of the altcoins that will bounce back the most; BTC, ETH, OCEAN, SOL, CTSI, ATOM, BNB, DIA. I don't know if you have noticed but some, if not all of these projects are even more active in the bear market. CTSI and OCEAN especially are still showing strength in addition to the continuous building. The best thing for now is to invest on BTC, But I think Also AVAX and ADA will bounce back that's I keep buying on Net coins Canada. ETH, BNB, OCEAN will definitely bounce back the most.

DataFi will make a trend, OCEAN BE introduced it. Data NFTs are also new and it's bringing a lot of uniqueness to the NFTs space. Ethereum is likely to make a strong comeback. It's got a lot of fantastic narratives around it rn. LINK is yet another, with staking opportunities now available for LINK holders, it'll definitely be a huge one. But then, LINK will pull a lot of top data oracle projects such as DIAdata DIA, API3 along with it.",0.9978

1,Help to learn cryptocurrency fundamentals?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/qw8yst/help_to_learn_cryptocurrency_fundamentals/,"Hey, i am really interested in cryptocurrencies, I already spent some time off and on learning about certain fundamentals of cryptocurrencies as for example Blockchain technologies, smart contracts, DEFI, and similar, but i was learning about it rather superficial.

I am very interested by the actual tech of cryptocurrencies and I think that its important to understand the tech and idea behind them to be able to make good investment choices. I thought the best way to start studying about cryptos would be a structured ""roadmap"" with good resources, i didnt really find anything as this online and dont have a great overview about all the different topics/importance of topics since i m new to it.

I wanted to ask if anyone could provide a good Roadmap or list for what they say would be important, interesting and good  to learn about how cryptocurrencies work and could maybe provide some resources on these topics. I was thinking about keywords in a structured order which i can research on and learn about, for example something like: 1. Blockchains 2. Smart contracts ...

I would also appreciate every kind of resource you could recommend

Thanks in advance, if anything was unclear, please tell me and i'll try to elaborate",1,5,False, Pluralsight has excellent trainings online on how blockchain works.,0.5719
1,Is it time to buy the dip?,https://www.newbiescrypto.com/p/time-buy-dip,,15,29,False," If you believe in something to invest in then the most reliable approach is dollar cost averaging. Otherwise, it‚Äôs really more of a gamble considering all the data points to more errors in prediction amongst analysts and financial gurus than successes. We may never have the right time to buy the dip because we all see things differently. However, before buying the dip, the project use case should be considered because not all projects have a good use case in the ecosystem. Railgun, for example, has been consistently innovative despite the market situation and still maintains a price range that makes it significant due to its strong fundamentals. If there are no hiccups in the way, ZEC might start a bullish run, and it wouldn't hurt to look at projects with strong fundamentals before buying. I'm going to sound like a broken record here but this has to get across to people. Stop buying meme dog coins right now and buy bluechips like Celo and ICP. Projects like these have never been seen at these prices. It's literally a once in a lifetime opportunity. Nope It's the beat time to invest in upcoming and new projects.

My money is on KOL ,the token of an upcoming project called KOLnet that monetizes influencers through whitelists and token swaps for their social media marketing services. Bear markets are made to DCA!   


Smaller, regular investments will get you better average entry points than throwing all your money at this market thats swinging like a tether ball on a rope in zero gravity.   
...tether reference intentional... Buying the dip means different thing to different people. DCAing is still the best strategy to make the best out of bear markets like this. Interestingly, some altcoins seem to be doing quite well in terms of price actions. A good example is Railgun which has maintained a consistent price over the month. I believe it has something to do with innovations it just introduced to privacy in decentralized finance. MKR is another one that has stood out in the market. I believe it is more reasonable to spend on dips when a good resistance has been exhibited to an extent, especially for low and mid caps. Access to good information is what we investors needs to progress financially and generally in life. DCA I think at these levels is an ideal strategy

1,Theta Network Fundamental Analysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/rf4myd/theta_network_fundamental_analysis/,"Below is my link to my new analysis of Theta. TLDR: 

It's easy to say that Theta Network is a crypto project everyone should have their eyes on for the next decade. Founded by experienced tech entrepreneurs, backed by HUGE brands, part of a big industry(video streaming) with a solid solution and fundamentals, Theta is far ahead of its competitors in the decentralized video streaming space. The burning question is; is Theta actually decentralized. At a glance, it doesn't appear to be.

Not only is the Theta Token supply heavily held in the Theta foundation, its partners and Enterprise nodes are large Web2 conglomerates alongside its media advisors who are executives at large tech companies. This isn't a bad thing to be clear, but for the crowd in crypto that only cares about decentralized projects, Theta might not be the best pick.¬†

In my opinion, Web3 will have an ecosystem where both centralized and decentralized projects will coexist and build off of one another. Theta is most certainly a dominant player in the centralized sphere.

1,I don‚Äôt think that striving for perfection in crypto will get you anywhere. Try keeping profitability and stability in mind instead.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/u8jvwb/i_dont_think_that_striving_for_perfection_in/,"This is a reminder not to dwell on the idea of making money and promising yourselves with multi gains. It‚Äôs true that crypto is giving us an opportunity to achieve financial freedom, as its true that only a few will get there. So keep your focus on the process if you really want the result.

My ultimate advice is never to invest in a project without reading its whitepaper, understanding it‚Äôs purpose (what problem does it aim to solve), and evaluating its team. Believe me when I tell you, a bit of research makes a huge difference. 

Try to relatively diversify your wallet, and rebalance based on each coin‚Äôs performance, especially that the market differs if it‚Äôs bullish or bearish. Keep in mind that to make money in crypto it‚Äôs not about getting every call correct. In fact you can make a number of bets, and only hit one winner to still come out ahead.

Personally I am a huge fan of technology, that‚Äôs why my wallet is based on MATIC tokens to hodl. Polygon has proved itself to be a top notch technological project trying to improve and shape the ecosystem. But of course that hasn‚Äôt stopped me from owning other coins, some resting with MATIC, while others being traded kind of on a daily basis.

Managing a portfolio isn‚Äôt simple, so start small. Believe there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. With experience start expanding your wallets. Don‚Äôt forget you need to keep your track on what‚Äôs happening in the market and following up on the daily news.

Let me know if there‚Äôs anything I‚Äôve missed. Hope you all be satisfied peeps! Goood luck!",18,38,False," There is no perfection in crypto. You get what you believe and buy what you want to back up. I started in 2017 with Ocean Protocol and eMoney, moved on with UTK and ultimately I end up with BTC and ETH. Still holding them all. Every project has it‚Äôs downsides and its important to know that. Thats explains why devs are always busy fixing the projects. Although, if a project has real use cases and solid fundamentals, that is pretty close to perfection. 

For example $DINO had my major bag and the dip couldn‚Äôt make me sell due to solid fundamentals and use case. Now that the project has rebranded to $GREEN, its more exciting as it allows staking with USDC, UST and USDT. You have a very valid point from all you have said, I must confess I once had that opinion of making it with just one project token but then it wasn't working out and passive income became the order of the day.

Ever since I have made a huge income from the likes of COSMOS, AAVE, JUNO but recently stumbled on Spool and it has really been outstanding because it's among the lowest risk DeFi platforms cause it is built on existing yield protocols, and that way giving users the flexibility to put their funds through multiple channels. A little research can go a long way but its not so easy too follow up on daily news and happenings in the market, there's a LOT.

 I like MATIC too, it's a project that consistently builds and grows. I started to accumulate more after their partnership with FUILD as its commit chain, also joined their [contest](https://twitter.com/FLUID_liquidity/status/1516477477413175301?s=20&t=8CgQx3aAXA6eNYTafgTEIQ) to win 500 USDT, you'd need to show proof that you hold MATIC if you're chosen as a winner.

I've also been playing a few games on Polygon during my free time ;) I was losing a lot when I was trying to be a professional. Now that I'm just passively putting what I can afford to do away with for a very long time, and also focusing on usecases and fundamentals of projects rather than what I stand to gain, I see myself making a whole lot more. Insane right.

DIA for instance has given me more gains than I can ever imagine. Beating what I have earned in many years of trading, and that's not an exaggeration. I think the announcement of the DIAdata alpha pools for its genesis NFTs gave a whooping 2k% APY. And I can't be more grateful for that opportunity. No one is perfect and grave mistakes are committed by experienced traders too. The only thing one can rely on is research, because thats what separates the diamonds from the stones. One such project is KOLnet , a DeFi based marketing dex that would monetize influencers through whitelists and pre-sale tokens/coins in lieu of their services. The SHO is on Infinity Pad on May 2nd. Its a unique concept and the team has not tried to make this the most perfect project there is, but a good sturdy platform which benefits both projects and influencers. I am totally sold on this concept and would allocate some of my funds to buy KOL. I sold my Matic at 4c & regretted. We win some, lose some. Though, I made some gains on QUICK ; its DEX & AMM platform. 

I believe Polygon will gain more adoption & users. It's obvious to tell with cross-chain liquidity aggregators like FLUID adopting it as its primary DeFi chain. I honestly do not think anyone in crypto would be yearning for perfection even when a more controlled systems isn't close to perfection, profitability has been achieved with different investments based on the solidity of the project just recently I looked into Cross-chain capital and I was overwhmeled with quite a number of streams of earning, its investment dao which isn't limited to a particular niche,its buy/sell tax which asset holders get paid; these are solid examples of profitability in crypto. Very good point mate. 

I stopped trying to find the perfect coin a couple of months back, and started investing in those projects I believe will be here 10 or more years from now. 

For example, the Ocean Protocol isn't too big gainer today, but their narrative, team efforts, concrete foundations, etc, are telling me that Ocean is here to stay and it will only become better in time, so my profits with them are a sure thing on long-term. 

That's the way I pick all my coins to invest... MATIC is a great project. I'm also a fan of OCEAN which is bridged to Polygon, Ethereum, BSC and Moonriver. Ocean is powering the web3 data economy.",0.999

Manipulation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/tw25uo/having_a_hard_time_wrapping_my_head_around_why/,"Honestly the crypto market is a mysterious beast to me. There's a ton of things I understand. There's a ton I think I understand but I probably don't and finally there's a whole lot of crap I just cannot wrap my head around no matter how hard I try. One thing I genuinely do not understand on an economic level is how some incredible projects are undervalued and some projects that honestly sometimes feel like they don't add anything or are just driven by hype are doing way better price or value wise.

I understand that hype is a big thing but jesus godamn, sometimes the entire market as a whole feels like it's driven by hype and people's opinions on projects and investments are just as volatile as the market.

I'm going to use Ethereum, Polygon, Cardano and Solana as an example. It was massive how much Solana was overhyped a year or two ago from now. This was it boys, this was the ""Eth killer"". Solana fanboys spread FUD about Ethereum and Polygon like the plague. Where are they now? The Solana team are known liars and VCs are literally moving to Polygon. It's all gone and I feel Polygon will replace Solana in the Top 10 in the future. We all know Ethereum is still king.

Cardano was and feels like it's straight up selling you a white paper. Incredibly over-valued and of course the old ""Eth killer"" narrative is used. Although I think Cardano is a great project and will do well, I do think it's over-valued and over-hyped.

What I'm trying to say is people are way too quick to get swept up by the hopium and the hype.  You must ground yourself in reality and shut out the noise. Hype comes and goes but projects putting in quality work despite the price not pumping the way you would like it to is a better long-term investment for me personally. Curious to hear your thoughts.",16,20,False," It think it's mostly because people expect it to 100X so people buy it (wich makes it go up massively) and then they sell it and it goes down 99% and it busts.

Good projects usually go up gradually and stay (relatively) stable. All of crypto price movements are completely manipulated. This is crypto, an industry that is built and thrives on hype. Those who are here for the tech or fundamentals are few and far between. Your average investor has never read a white paper, has no idea what block validation or proof of X means. All they see are likes, views, retweets and # of followers. Period. This will not change. The stock market runs the same way and always has. Get used to it and adapt. Invest in projects that not only have solid fundamentals but also have a good marketing strategy. This is just as critical to a project‚Äôs success as it‚Äôs tech. I personally will not consider projects that focus solely on technical issues. They have to be able to sell themselves for me to buy in. Obviously BTC is king. But the rest of what you said is spot on. Eth is prince of crypto. BTC will always be king Don't underestimate large financial institutions buying and using PR agencies to spread hype, then rugging thier profits. 
They have every tool to do that already available, a clear incentive, and nothing to stop them as it's an unregulated market.
I'm convinced things like the shib and doge pump of 2021  and many of the majorly hyped shircoins was institutional money makey a quick 100x on the backs of some unsuspecting folks. The p\[robel is that people always fall for hopium rather than real development, I have seen so many good projects not being pumped due to the same reason but I am confident that lox network will make its mark pretty quickly as they are looking to solve the problem of mobile theft.",0.9902
1,Most innovative crypto projects. What's piquing your interest rn fellas?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/trrc1h/most_innovative_crypto_projects_whats_piquing/,"In building a bullish case for a crypto company most people tend to start (and stop) with whitepapers and roadmaps. A new project gets launched and pumped up by a couple whales, speculation gets amplified, personalities are hyped along with their projects, and a few months down the line it usually all ends up in tears ($TIME, et al.)

Beyond all the mess and fake hype, I believe there are innovative projects with ironclad fundamentals that tend to fly under most people's radars.

Among my new favorites, I'm bullish on [Zebec.io](https://Zebec.io) , a continuous settlement protocol that allows for real-time continuous streams of payments. Also very bullish on [liquality.io](https://liquality.io), a multi-chain ""superwallet"" with one-lick atomic swaps that makes Metamask (and their support team) look like hot gabage.

Curious to find out what under-the-radar projects everyone is currently bullish on.

&#x200B;

Please, no nft's or ""node"" projects

Edit: Ty so much for all the suggestions. Lots of great projects to go through!",72,182,False," I'm a software engineer (but a beginner in blockchain development) and interested in new ideas on digital wallets.

This lead me to RadixDLT (XRD). Since the project allows developers to use XRD's defi libraries and the Radix Engine to build their own DApps, it opens up a world of innovation from people with ideas. More developers contributing, more potential to find gems. I like to use Scrypto (to learn for now) for accessing Radix engine because it is written in Rust language and documentation is just \[chef's kiss\].

This is just an oversimplification but it is very robust and I'm definitely looking forward to that project's future and the developers using their ecosystem like myself.

Another gem which is very new but will offer another neat wallet idea is RoboInu Finance (RBIF). The person who started it was an ex-Google developer, and passed to an experienced software project lead, and she's been kicking ass, in my opinion. Since I'm really into community and collaboration, RBIF's culture has captured my interest. It's not about hyping, it's not about pumping, but about nourishing the community by continued support and offering solutions. RBIF has a special place in my heart. lol

The 2 products/solutions I'm very interested about are their flagship RoboWallet and RoboLaunchpad (which aligns with my interest for collaboration).

RadixDLT is already a mature project while RoboInu Finance is still very very new. I think financially, you can gain a lot from RBIF in a year or 2. ;) IOTA.

All I can say for certainty is It's not some Shiba or Inu spin-off. The amount of different Inu shill posts in here is crazy. this thread is sketchy af. Zenon Network. Basically a potential new scaling layer for native Bitcoin which doesn‚Äòt have the shortcomings of the Lightning Network rbif easy Levolution, It's a new tokenization platform. You guys should check it out I‚Äôm an $RBIF holder, happy to see it recommended here. Ms. Vy, the lead dev knows her stuff and has connections in all the right places. She is building utility and not interested in getting a hype pump. The hype will come when the utility is delivered and the utility will carry the project into the long term. 

The first prototype of the Robo wallet is anticipated in April. The big point of differentiation with Robo wallet is that it will support cross border transactions. Send crypto and have the recipient receive fiat in their native currency! Nano is innovative. Already reached its max supply, no inflation, no transaction fees. It does its job filling the role as currency better than Bitcoin.

I still think BTC will succeed, mind you, but Nano is the sleeper I dream about.

* Baghold BTC because of the unreasonable hype and media attention securing it at #1.
* Baghold Nano because it's actually what we should be using as a global currency.
* Don't Baghold Monero. Because I don't have any. Stop asking, IRS! I too think the robowallet from RBIF will be a game changer.  I love the idea of being able to convert crypto to any native fiat without the mess of exchanges or uniswap. DFK $JEWEL, Insane team and vision, about to launch onto AVAX tomorrow after a very successful time on Harmony since last August, big future in my opinion. Do you let own research and come to your own conclusions, everyone here will just shill some bullshit they have an investment in regardless of it‚Äôs legitimate or not TRAC - Solid project, team, real deployed use cases, polkadot integration and much more, look it up. LUNA, KDA and Harmony ONE. All are unique in their own right and trying to solve the scalability problem. Check out Robo Inu Finance! It is a solid project with LOTS of potential. The dev team is super transparent and rewards you for holding the coin. One way they reward you is through reflections, another way is by the big air drop coming when we hit 5K holders. Everyone with $500 will receive a $100 airdrop, everyone with $1000 will receive a $200 airdrop, and finally everyone with $1500 will receive a $300 airdrop. It sounds crazy but that‚Äôs just how much the developers care about the project and it‚Äôs growth. 
In order to receive the airdrop, you must purchase RBIF through a wallet, not bitmart. There is so much more to talk about but just do your own research and feel free to ask me anything! RBIF!!!üöÄüöÄüöÄ I‚Äôve recently bought into Robo Inu. Solid organic growth over last month or so. CEO Ms Vy is top rate and keeps everyone informed of developments. Very confident on this project and would recommend people look at the AMAs they‚Äôve done on YouTube to get an understanding of its potential. [deleted] Navcoin's BlsCT privacy protocol I would never buy any coin with the word ‚Äúinu‚Äù in it lol fools One of the best for innovations is the Ocean Protocol.

This DataFi project is one of the leaders in WEB3 development, the issuer of OCEAN coin and H2O stablecoin.

Maybe the most important part of this project is their OceanDao, community voting, which already funded more than 200 new DeFi projects.

The Ocean is a really important crypto project with a bright future... I‚Äôm also eagerly anticipating the launch of Coyote Coin. This project is one that everyone will wish they had gotten into early. 

The utility is being kept guarded so that no one tries to steal their idea, but there have been enough hints to understand that it will revolutionize crypto. 

The two big things they set out to address are. 

1. The complexity of entering the crypto market for someone who has no knowledge about it. They will be the Apple of crypto. Make it so that a 75year old can easily be aware of projects and invest in them. 

2. Whale manipulations. How frustrated are we as retail investors to see whales draining profits over and over again. They hurt the chart. Well, Coyote Coin is implementing a Harpoon Tax to discourage whale dumps. If any wallet tries to sell more than 5% of the previous 24hr trading volume, the sell tax gets ratcheted up to about 33%, with 10% of that getting redistributed to holders. Omfg not a robo inu infestation LRC Venice Finance by far is the most interesting project out right now. They are working with zk proofs and developing bulletproofs. I would say they are heavily sleep on at the moment Robo inu finance Holy shit, can you say paid shills?

OriginTrail is my pick every time - they are building something totally unique (decentralized knowledge graph), have some of the most impressive partners in the space (DKG is being used by numerous fortune 500 companies), and they are about to hit the big stage (they will be in the next round of parachain auctions).

TRAC is about to go on a LINK-tier run and no one is paying attention yet.

Community resources explaining the project:

www.origintrailexplained.info

www.tracdeepdive.info

www.origintrail.club $AZERO - sick team pushing near zero latency finality with absurd TPS, all under a privacy layer, built on substrate for interoperability. Multiple bridges incoming etc. Whilst not a blockchain but rather a DAG, it can operate as a parathread on Polkadot ecosystem.

This is really the cutting edge in terms of speed and finality in 2022. Very exciting project. Scrt network I like what Kalmar is doing. It‚Äôs a DeFi banking project but they are also oriented on NFTs but I will skip that part since you mentioned that you don‚Äôt wanna hear about NFTs. The feature that I like the most is their leveraged yield farming. With leverage up to x6.5 your returns will be higher + you don‚Äôt need high amounts to start. They also have a good lending program.

I still believe in BMI as well because I think that they can really make an impact on the market when it comes to security and preventing losses. Thorchain The crypto space is filled with project that claimed to be DAO but functions otherwise, Cross-chain capital has took to itself to be firm by exhiniting the true feature of a DAO system; I also like the fact that it is actually not limited to any niche in the space. I fancy when a project tackles a real-life problem and thats exactly what Ore Network is doing, identity managment across multiple chains and it also has a multisig asset management service built on ORE ID for business people and many more. Imperial College of London has a crypto called Vector Space Biosciences VXV https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/234034/ai-life-sciences-research-gets-boost/ I would say Nimiq. It‚Äôs a wallet built directly into your browser and through it is actually a nano node that gives you direct access to the blockchain. This is done using zk proofs which is decentralization at its best. It will soon transition to PoS and allowing staking and faster transaction speeds. KDA Titano Stargate (STG) from layer zero labs. DeFi Kingdoms. Mark my words, shit is about to get wild. Some incredibly innovative things in the works. They plan to be a host chain of new GameFi projects. Easy integration, their own Subnet on Avalanche, and a thriving ecosystem on Harmony. Just do yourself a favor and punch it into a search anywhere, YouTube, Twitter or even their subreddit and prepare to be impressed. Haha your Mom Stellar cannacoin all day! Does anyone know what wallet I can connect to Kraken exchange? Flux If WMT is successful, all other projects listed in this thread will be  successful. Currently half the world have no internet. So we vantage really have mass adoption until they do. World Mobile Token connecting the unconnected. Look into it. Saito what caught my attention to investing in a project is usually the solution it brings to the space for instance TXA which provide a decentralized settlement layer to exchange which fastens transaction speed I'm bullish on AIOZ long term, 19.5% APY staking rewards at the moment, dCDN for video content streaming. They have a YouTube alternative going to mainnet soon, and Netflix like streaming planned for the future. I run nodes to earn and then stake. It's a long play for me with expected massive gains in 5-8 years time. I think Kadena is having a really good idea with their Gas station thingy

Basically dapps can run gas free and you only get charged for transfers while dapps work with no gas fees

BUT also, we need modular multichain wallets.Maybe even a more ""premium one"" where you pay a subscription just so the developers can focus on the wallet and keeping it up and running instead of basically doing it for free but that idk if it's gonna happen soon Rubic. The site is rubic.exchange. Trade any asset across 6+ blockchains in 1 trade. Just got listed on kraken. 30M mcap For 2022 I am bullish on data protocols (Ocean, Graph, etc) and also I believe stablecoins will do good (USDC, eMoney and others.) The Graph Been a DeFi enthusiast since 2020. Love exploring different protocols & see the benefits they offer.

Even though it might not be the best, but I like OIN Finance approach to stablecoins, as it allows users to leverage on their native assets & mint stablecoins, while having exposure.

Amazing yield farming programs for every USD assets integrated, buyback & burn, governance, new partnerships keep coming. Looking forward to Green rebrand to greenhouse from dinoswap. Could be one to watch out for DAFI with their synthetic d-tokens helping inflation control in native tokens Zucoins wallet and coins this June , you can never lose your money transferring coins, it‚Äôs ‚Äú dummy proof, referred to as the Bitcoin killer, permission less, no energy required, it is what Facebook was trying to be, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Facebook or Meta bought them out, Bumpity bump I'm currently bullish on NGM for payment using the 5 EU currency stablecoins that's fully collaterized which the team have issues so far

Bullish on OCEAN protocol for data democratisation and monetization

Bullish on ATOM interopability. JUNO, OSMO, SCRT are all my picks with AAVE and DYDX Looksrare I would suggest you check out the E-money project, the issuer of fully backed stablecoins for the European market. 

It resembles other projects first because all the coins are backed, and second those funds are transparent and checked quarterly by Ernst & Young. 

All those coins also are instant settlements with near-zero fees... So many projects are popping up which have no real world use case apart from  farming some sort of token.

But one project which I got caught on is [cheqd.io](https://cheqd.io). Never heard of it but received a cosmos airdrop a couple of days ago. So, I had a closer look at it what these guys are actually doing. 

And their vision is pretty impressive. Creating an ecosystem for self-sovereign identity management based on blockchain technology. It has many, many real world use cases related to identity management. Well worth a closer look! I staked my airdrop and will probably invest a couple of more dollars into this project. Froggies token, metavice and Shibnobi Feg. The winner of the best smartdefi project st dubsi. Crypto expo recently I like what Duelist King is doing. Though a gaming project, they are revolutionizing the gaming industry, and bringing on transparency and true decentralization to the gaming space. I think one just got launched today. Identifying the general challenge most DeFi experience with interacting with several DeFi yield generating protocols and the implications of the extra multiple fees they pay in the process. Spoolfi came on board as an automated DeFi router that takes deposits from a user, irrespective of their knowledge or skill level in DeFi, and automatically channels the users' deposit into multiple yield generators (Aave, Curve, Compound, Idle etc.). without the need for paying multiple gas fees and going through the rigors of rebalancing. If my definition of innovation isn't inaccurate, Spool fits right in. I believe you know that there are a lot of privacy protocols in space at the moment. With increasing demand, their relevance is shining brighter. Speaking of innovation, I believe Railgun qualifies to be referenced in that regard due to the absolute inclusion of everything that can be transacted on the blockchain. Its NFT support i.e. providing the option to anonymously auction NFTs; Also, being multi-chain composable with no bridges ensures that its security is miles ahead of the conventional privacy protocols. The big innovation comes from the smart utilization of zkSNARKS technology in the design of its privacy system. The interesting part is that zksnarks has been considered by many to be revolutionary. The most innovative project that I've come across should be Unido. How it used the multisig wallet to reduce the cost of operating a crypto custodial solution still amazes me till today. Projects with good strategic partnerships, backers, quality exchanges, active communities, and a quality development team, in my opinion, will ultimately deliver, which is why I find Duelist King innovative and proactive. I got a sense of it during the alpha testing of its game, where participants provided feedback in order to fix the bugs that were reported. I'm really bullish on what Solana is doing these days, they're really giving back to the community through organizing hacker houses in NYC and teaching the up and coming developers of everything related to blockchain technology. 

They've also been decreasing their carbon emissions and implementing insurance funds on their IDO incubators like SoIana prime to protect investors. It would be one of the best Blockchain gaming projects, Mecha Morphing for me.

It's funny how many now find crypto games ""unsustainable"" all of a sudden when actually many had wanted a means to earn while gaming when trag gaming was still in the limelight.

Mecha Morphing will be sustainable IMO. Gameplay, graphics, etc all superb. Team behind it are also not new to gaming or Blockchain projects. They are very much established. I think that will fly. Stablecoin related projects like E-money and Finance Oin piques my interest the most at the moment. Both are innovative projects that are making waves, have solid utility and unlock decent sources of passive income but are still undervalued.

Mainstream stablecoin adoption is coming and I'm bullish on these two under-the-radar projects. Won't hurt to check them out.

Zebec and liquality seems interesting enough. It has to be OCEAN. There's a lot we can do with our data away from it being stolen by oligarchs such as Google and Facebook. OCEAN enables us to take control of our data and monetize it while preserving its privacy.

The [OCEAN V4](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-public-testing-is-now-live-691de33b8498) public testing was announced today. Kalmar‚Äôs creation of a DeFi hub with NFTs and Gamifi piqued my interest, a lot of people could also find it interesting and innovative.

I also think the introduction of next generation NFTs with advanced features by Unique network, to create web3 solutions in art and gaming seems to be a brilliant idea, which come from the team building the chain on substrate, which hasn‚Äôt been done before. I like the introduction of a strong multi-chain stablecoin issuance platform on OIN and ZK proofs for privacy on SCRT and ROSE, as well as Data oracle,¬†piqued my interest. As at now my interests is majorly in the Web3 ecosystem, with the whole crypto industry getting all excited about the decentralization that comes with Web3, i believe all eys should be on gems in the ecosystem like GRT, DEIP, FLUX etc. Some couple of projects are proving the fact that the fast-paced nature of the crypto is responsible for the endess innovative possibilities available within the ecosystem. 

Platforms like Greenhouse rebranding strikes as innovative because it solves the previous hyperinflation problem of by making swaps 100 DINO to 1 GREEN token. The innovative ecosystems of $MATIC is also interesting. One of the most innovative project I came across was Kolnet, they will be launching their Kol coin soon. The platform debuts as the first DEX and marketing launchpad.The launchpad bridges projects owners and micro-KOLs. KOLnet is primed to put an end to flat launches. Its $Elite for me. These are some of the perks;

Sharing content in a new way
Promoting freedom of expression
Distributing quality content from verified celebrities
Building a reward system for creators
Managing licenses and rights to pictures and videos


For the investor:
Speculating on the increase in value of $ELITE tokens
Buying NFTs that generate passive income
Buying exclusive products or products on sale
Farming


For the influencer:
Selling content in NFTs
Earning money from the secondary market


Its a bunch of good news One of the most innovative crypto project I came across is Kolnet which try to bridges micro influencers and key opinion leaders. Kolnet being the first marketing Dex is going to be a game changer. The cryptos with the best tech right now IMO are NEAR, ICP, and IOTA. I don't think anyone can argue against those. The real GEM of 2022 has just launched a couple of days ago.  
  
This project has a real life utility and is something trully amazing.  
  
  
  
The Science DAO solves several problems for retail investors, institutions, and inventors. Profound scientific startups are generally not available to the public due to high barriers of entry and non existent deal flow; geography and accreditation sometimes present issues as well. For institutions, many early stage funds deal with an illiquid seed investment in which they are married to a company for many years before any liquidity event. Inventors with promising ideas are in need of expert advice, mentorship, licensing or corporate guidance, and lastly risk capital prior to proof of concept. The Science DAO will enable crypto investors to put their crypto value into a new asset. It will help funds gain access to new deal flow with the opinion of experts in those related industries without having to seek consultation. It would foster growth for inventors and entrepreneurs that are still in need for risk capital. It would take the pressure off single investors by mitigating risk through decentralized governance and fundraising.

1,The Fundamental Bull Case for HNT (DD),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/oh6wez/the_fundamental_bull_case_for_hnt_dd/,"**Preface and Disclosures:**

None of the information presented is to be taken as financial advice. I am merely a broke college student with too little time on my hand that happens to really like this coin. I personally am currently mining HNT and thus benefit from positive price movements. I am likely to be biased as I have a permanent position in the aforementioned currency and hold an optimistic (bullish) view. 

**What is the People‚Äôs Network?**

Helium, the people‚Äôs network, is a low power, high range, low bandwidth, wireless network provided by individuals. The network is intended to service Internet of Things (‚ÄúIoT‚Äù) devices and enable real time data transfer via this network. The wireless technology used in this network is LoRaWAN, a patented low power high range radio signal technology. The network itself is provided by the people as they host hotspots from their homes, offices, or friends‚Äô homes. These hotspots provide the wireless network for others to use by sending out a wireless signal and connecting to the Helium blockchain via the internet. The incentive for hotspot owners to provide this network is that they get compensated for the use and coverage of the network in the cryptocurrency Helium Token (HNT). These hotspots are effectively miners. All current real time data relating to the network can be found on Helium‚Äôs explorer page (*Helium Explorer*, 2020).

**Why use The People‚Äôs Network?**

The main use for the Helium network is to connect IoT devices. This already provides a wide breadth of use cases. The primary reason however is affordability and convenience. Companies that wish to use this network need not build their own infrastructure as the network is being provided by many individuals. The cost of use is a fraction of that when compared to a conventional cellular connection. Additionally, the devices themselves do not need a lot of power to stay connected to the network and eliminate the need for a sim card. Furthermore, all connections are encrypted and anonymized, and thus unlikely to be susceptible to breaches. This makes for a very attractive proposal to large businesses and startups looking to utilize the network. The low cost and lack of need for maintenance is more than compelling for any balance sheet. Even private individuals would be incentivized to use the network for their own personal solution. 

**What using the network means for HNT and current use cases.**

Currently, quite a few companies have signed on to use the network and quite a few startups are looking to launch their product and utilize the network. Here is a list of some of the most promising use cases with a list of companies in parenthesis:

¬∑ Asset Tracking (digital matter, Conserv, Lonestar Tracking, Lime)

o Asset tracking implies putting a GPS tracker that utilizes the helium network to ascertain the location of specific assets. By utilizing Helium, the trackers need less power, are cheaper to use and require no infrastructure to be set up by the utilizing company. The assets can range from micro mobility devices such as rental bikes, scooters, skateboards and others, to cars, paintings and construction vehicles (*Use The People‚Äôs Network*, 2019).

¬∑ Package Tracking (Barnacle)

o Packages can be independently tracked from the shipping company and prevent package theft, package loss, and accurate real time tracking of packages. The receiver would gain access to a specific hash that they can use to track their package. This is intended for high value product orders. A return address is printed on the back of the tracker itself and once the package has arrived at its intended destination the customer can send the tracker back via conventional mail (Boen, 2021).

¬∑ Pet tracking (InvisiLeash)

o A dog or cat collar fitted with a helium tracker can allow the owner to quickly and accurately locate their lost pet. Additionally, the low power necessary means that the tracker doesn‚Äôt need to be charge frequently. It can also automatically activate only once the pet has left a specified area to conserve using data credits when it isn‚Äôt necessary (*Use The People‚Äôs Network*, 2019).

¬∑ Vehicle and Metropolitan Uses (Nobel Systems)

o What if you were to need to find parking quickly and accurately in any metropolitan area? Using the Helium network, sensors by parking spaces could tell you in real time which parking spaces are free and which ones are occupied. Additionally, parking could be charged automatically (*Use The People‚Äôs Network*, 2019).

¬∑ Health Monitoring (CareBand)

o Elderly people have quite a few challenges to face in their twilight years, especially those suffering from dementia and other memory and cognitive impairment diseases. By having them wear a bracelet that monitors their activity and if necessary, their location, loved ones can be quickly found and helped in the case of an emergency (*Use The People‚Äôs Network*, 2019).

¬∑ Agricultural Monitoring (Agulus)

o A lot of agricultural machinery is moving in the direction of atomization. Being able to control and monitor said machinery by utilizing the Helium network would reduce costs, provide enough range to cover vast amounts of land, and instantly notify the operator if any intervention is necessary (*Use The People‚Äôs Network*, 2019).

These use cases are quite promising and provide a real-world application that is useful to the consumer as well as the provider. Helium provides a robust decentralized network that is safe, cost effective and useful. Now that we have established why one would use this network, lets delve in to what happens when you do.

Users of the network need to pay for its utilization. They can do this by using Data Credits (DC). DC are created by burning the crypto token HNT. Burning means that the token is removed from the supply forever. One HNT is worth 1 million DC. Thus, the utilization of the network increases demand by reducing supply. Supply is replenished by hotspot owners and Validators that maintain and provide the network.

**Tokenomics of HNT**

HNT is the cryptocurrency that is mined by hotspots and validators of the network. Data Credits are used by devices to send data on the network and for transaction fees on the blockchain. They can only be obtained by burning HNT, are non-transferrable and tied to a single user. The cost of data transfer using DC is fixed and does not fluctuate with the price of HNT. However, the amount of data credits one HNT is worth does fluctuate. This is known as oracle price. The oracle price is close to the trading price but more stable and averaged out based on trading price. For example, if HNT is currently trading at 15$ and the oracle price for 1 HNT is 15.50$ then one HNT is worth 1.55 million DC. HNT has a Maximum supply of 223M HNT and the mining of the token is halved every two years on the network‚Äôs genesis anniversary. The first halving is scheduled for August 1st 2021. The ultimate goal is to achieve a minting and use equilibrium. Due to HNT needing to be burned to use the network, Helium miners and validators can continue to earn rewards after the maximum supply has been mined. Additionally, a reserve pool is allocated over time. A certain percentage of newly minted HNT is kept in a reserve pool that can be used to pay out miners and validators over time after max supply has been reached guaranteeing a continued rewarding of providing network coverage. This is known as Net Emissions (*What Are Net Emissions?*, 2021).

**Requirements for Mining HNT**

HNT can only be mined by one of two methods. The first is by providing network coverage with a Helium hotspot, creating proof of coverage challenges, passing proof of coverage challenges, witnessing other hotspots passing proof of coverage challenges, and for transferring data. Only hotspots created by approved manufacturers are able to mine and DIY hotspots can be used as a relay to provide a larger coverage area. As previously mentioned, there is not proof-of-work hash rate or hashing like it is currently the case with ETH and BTC. The heavy lifting in terms of processing power has been moved from hotspots to Validators as of the 7th of July 2021. As an aside, Hotspots barely use any power themselves, a RAK V2 Hotspot uses an average of 12W, thus making the mining very profitable in comparison to traditional proof-of-work mining. The second method is by staking 10k HNT and becoming a validator. A validator is a server that runs the blockchain and offloads most of the processing power required for the blockchain and verifies and validates transactions and block integrity. In order for a validator to be online, 10k HNT must be staked. The current official APY for staking is 22% with the halving on August 1st taken in to consideration. Third party pool-based staking platforms may offer higher or lower returns. 

**Mining mechanics and mining profitability**

As mentioned previously, miners provide the network and get compensated for it. This means effectively there is no hash rate as it does not mine via a proof-of-work but via proof-of-coverage. However, there are some conditions. Every miner should be at least 300m apart from each other. Furthermore, the denser an area the more the rewards of miners are scaled down. Scaling means that hotspots that are close together will have their rewards automatically scaled down by a multiplier. For example, if there are too many hotspots in an area the mining scale might be .50 which means that every reward paid out will be multiplied by .50 and thus the reward is half of what it would normally be. Covering areas with less hotspots but enough to forge connections and witness each other is ideal. Everyone benefits from areas that are less congested. Additionally, miners need to have their location asserted during initial setup or when it is moved. This requires the owner to pay a DC fee. The location needs to be fixed and can not be mobile as that would defeat the purpose for providing coverage to a specified location. There are solutions however of having miners set up in remote fixed locations by using cellular for transmitting internet traffic and solar for power. As for profitability, at the time of writing well performing HNT miners can mine around 100HNT per month. After the halving that would be 50HNT per month. At current average trading price of 13$ that is 1300$ per month and after the halving 650$ per month. However, it is likely that the halving will increase the price as demand increases and minting has been cut in half. The initial cost for a miner and a decent antenna comes to around 400-500$ per unit. That means after the halving the ROI for a miner would be less than one month for a miner that performs very well and is in optimal conditions. Furthermore, it is worth considering getting multiple miners and setting them up in multiple locations in preferable less dense areas. Having a healthy 3km or 2-mile distance between each miner would be optimal. Each miner will mine to the same wallet address and they are capable of witnessing each other for extra payouts. The power draw being between 13W and 15W makes this a very attractive proposition as this is negligible in comparison to standard proof of work mining. The only cost consideration would be internet as a miner is known to use about 30GB of data each month which may be a factor for miners running on cellular internet connections. 

**Security**

The HNT wallet is currently available in two forms, the mobile app with fingerprint and other biometric unlocking methods, as well as a command line interface wallet. The CLI wallet requires more caution on behalf of the user (*Wallets | Helium Documentation*, 2019). The mobile app also uses a 14-word security pass phrase and has the option to further secure the wallet with a pin and biometric identifier. The 14 words need to be backed up and secured otherwise the wallet may be lost forever. Each wallet additionally uses asymmetric private keys. Transactions are secured by validators and are just as anonymous and encrypted as a transaction on the ETH blockchain. As for the security regarding hacking, the most common attack vector on hotspots is the only required port that needs to be open is TCP 44158. All other inbound and outbound connections can be blocked or adjusted as needed. The connection the hotspot forges however is exclusively to the blockchain and the connection from each device to the hotspot as well as hotspot to blockchain are encrypted with AES private key encryption at the chip level. Furthermore, each device communicates with the hotspot via LongFi or LoRaWAN and not IP (Internet Protocol). While inexpensive, each transaction and data transfer require DC and thus isn‚Äôt free. This also serves as a deterrent for potential hacking attempts and scammers. The radio and wireless signals emitted also all comply with each region‚Äôs wireless regulations regarding unlicensed frequency bands (*Security FAQ | Helium Documentation*, 2019).

**Forward looking speculative outlook for HNT**

As outlined, HNT has a very strong fundamental case in terms of Tokenomics, mining and use cases. I firmly believe that there is a demand for the use cases outlined, and further use cases that are yet to be developed may completely outshine the ones on display here. Something that has not been mentioned is that there is additionally a 5G network coming to Helium. This is supposed to offload regular 5G network traffic when the cellular providers are overloaded to ensure more stable connections and less slowdowns overall. It would use DC for the data transfer costs thus reducing supply. Separate 5G miners are in production, but as of this time they do not factor in to the Helium network yet. The 5G network could however bring on millions of users helping to achieve burn and mint equilibrium faster than expected and may even outpace the minting (Haleem, 2021). As for the fair price of HNT, as of time of writing, HNT has reached an ATH of 22$ per coin and currently trades at around 13$ a coin. In my estimation based on the fundamentals outlined here, a realistic fair price of 30$ per coin is not unheard of. A speculative value of 150$ per coin post halving and increased interest in the project is realistic. This assessment is based on the fact that the market is massive if helium truly succeeds. When taking a burn to mint equilibrium in to account, the value of HNT should be 20$ per $1M DC usage. The current usage of DC on the network is $1.5M thus the assessment of 30$ (*James Fayal on*, 2021). The halving may introduce an increased interest in purchasing the coin as mining rewards will be reduced by half and thus demand will increase. Overall, fundamentally, HNT is a solid project with realistic prospects and use cases. 

**TL:DR**

Helium is a wireless network that companies are champing at the bit to use as its cheaper than cellular. The demand for the coin will increase as more companies develop uses for it as the only way to use the network is by burning its cryptocurrency. The only way to obtain it is by buying or mining, thus the demand for HNT could skyrocket if the use cases are compelling enough. HNT go BRR in the long run.

I have 10 miners ordered, the wait is so long *Adds to watchlist üëÄ*. Thanks OP! Good read.  Keep it up Great write-up! I‚Äôve been looking for more info on mining HNT, but I‚Äôm curious: how would the halving of mining rewards draw in new people? Does that not mean less money?",0.9376
1,Getting into crypto this year before it‚Äôs too late,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/s9zx2s/getting_into_crypto_this_year_before_its_too_late/,"Now that I have some extra money I can use, I am planning to invest in crypto this year. I‚Äôm planning to buy some through binance (but if you guys have suggestions then that would be awesome) then will probably hodl or try my luck with trading. With this, I‚Äôm thinking of using Bybit or Kraken.

I don‚Äôt have a lot of money to use though, so I feel a little discouraged.  Will $300 be enough to start? What‚Äôs the best strategy to get good gain from crypto? I only have Youtube to rely on when it comes to researching so your thoughts will really help.",143,131,False," Some piece of advice I wish I knew before I started:  
\-Don‚Äôt FOMO.  
\-Buy when no one is buying.  
\-Understand the fundamentals of a project you‚Äôre trying to get yourself into.  
\-Beware of scams. There‚Äôs a shit ton of them, especially here.  
  
When it comes to how much you should start on, honestly, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Your $300 is already more than enough. It is best to start small since you‚Äôre just starting and you‚Äôre exploring. On my end i started with 200 and just kept hodling.  
  
Also, since you‚Äôre going to trade, learn to stop/prevent losses and do risk management. When I first started with crypto, I kind of regretted going into it without completely preparing myself so do your research and be cautious.  
  
Also, if you‚Äôre in the US, then you‚Äôre going to have problems with binance since it will require you to use a VPN. I would suggest going for Coinbase Pro (though I‚Äôm using coinbase since it works in where i am right now). With trading, I think you‚Äôre already good with those two. I‚Äôm familiar with both Bybit (through their sub r/Bybit) and I‚Äôm currently trying to figure my way on Kraken. Don't buy with money you can't afford to lose I use Binance and haven‚Äôt had any issues with it. 

As a strategy, I buy and hold. You learn quick that you can‚Äôt time the market, so right now in particular is a good time to get in. When you inevitably start to panic watching your investment drop, take a breather and put your phone down. You don‚Äôt want to become your typical idiot and sell at a loss because you were convinced losing it all was imminent. I made alot of money from June 2021 to Nov 2021 and now back down to 0 profit. Sell on the way up don't get sucked in hodl culture. Less learned now I will sell a little every 10k so I have some $ at the bottom. This is my advice :
If you are planning to invest, let‚Äôs say 1000$ ok? 
Don‚Äôt go allin with 1000$ on a price. Enter with 200$, next day see if the price dropped more (considering we are definitely on bear market), if goes down more, buy other 200$.. and so 

Same if you want to sell. Stay away from you tube! Slowly add your funds. DCA into the markets. In this bear market try and keep the majority of your funds in BTC and ETH Dont go all in ,since the market can dip more Have fun don't expect to make money any time soon. Lol  

I put like 1500 in 14 months ago, spread across some promising coins. The transfer fees, limits on exchange values and sluggish market over the time has left me with about .... 1650. It was fun for a while there but it's really been a boring process the last while. Imagine this.

Everyone kept telling me stop keeping my savings in banks.

A year down the line after starting with ¬£28k now looking @ ¬£12k spread in mainly link and eth.

What a ü§° I am.

Shoudlve just kept it in the ****ing bank..üè¶ Buy the dip!!! There‚Äôs a lot of it going on recently so you should have taken advantage of that. Too late? Have you been outside today? Might want to hodl that cash in a savings account for a bit You want to trade on bybit as a baby minnow. Please don't. Buy and hold. Start with large cap first imo Some advice. Long term holders are used to this and they don't usually go around reddit or telegram posting crap. Only FUDers and newbies with panic selling hands do it. As for me, I maintain my position on BTC since 2015, ETH since 2017, Ocean since 2019, and my NGM staking since last year. The fundamentals did not change. I can't speak for anyone else, but...I am new to crypto, and right this week, I am happy about the dip, but holding off on buying until I see what my taxes will look like when I file as soon as all the docs come in. I usually file my tax return at the end of February.

I suspect that many people who are interested in crypto are also waiting. Some will decide they don't have the funds to buy more, and a few of us will have a small windfall that we use to buy more.

Therefore, I suspect that there will be a general bump in the upwards direction at the end of February. Late or not, it‚Äôs better late than never, man. Good luck on this endeavor of yours. You should buy during dips. Just go slow and steady is the key. See you on the moon, buddy. Taking loans and buying dips for last several months thinking that, today is going to be my last investment. Doomed completely!! ‚ÄòBuy and hold‚Äô is the mantra of every Ponzi scheme.  The meaning behind this is, don‚Äôt cash out before I do.

And what are ‚Äògood fundamentals‚Äô for a currency with no tangible value?  I see this referred to constantly. Can someone provide a link that covers the fundamentals of a good token? how i started, aped in potential gem like eth, hold and stake on gems like Sylo that has a decent around 80% simple and works pretty good. Buy books of stock market, forget YouTube. Yes, binance is the best place to start. As much as I wanted, it would be more beneficial for me as a newbie crypto guy to look for good projects that is still small and I know has a huge potential. I stumbled across Brewlabs which is an awesome project with so many utilities. I know that they will become big sooner or later. The team behind the project is so good. The community is one of the best too. You guys may want to check their whitepaper and you will know why they're good. brewlabs.info is their website or go to CMC to check their details.

1,"The amount of Ethereum (ETH) staked on the Beacon Chain has reached its highest-ever levels, but some observers are growing concerned over a large sell-off after the Merge.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v4cfhc/the_amount_of_ethereum_eth_staked_on_the_beacon/,"The amount of ETH staked in the Beacon Chain smart contract has reached 12.76 million according to Glassnode. It reported that 398,000 unique validators have staked and an additional 19,800 staked and came online in May. 

Glassnode also claims that the amount of staked ETH is 10.73% of the circulating supply. At current prices, the value of those locked up assets is around $23.3 billion.

Other sources vary slightly with the Ethereum Launchpad dashboard reporting 13.36 million ETH staked, which works out at 11% of the total supply.

Either way, the increase in staking and validating is a vote of confidence for the Ethereum ecosystem in a bear market that is mired in negative sentiment and FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) at the moment.

The Merge effect

The highly anticipated Ethereum Merge is set to take place in Aug, however it has some industry onlookers concerned. The Merge will end proof-of-work mining and transition the network to proof-of-stake reducing its energy consumption by more than 99%.

Many in the crypto community seem to think that all of this staked ETH will be sold to markets once the Merge takes place. This is unlikely to occur for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the staked assets will not be immediately released when the Merge takes place as it is needed to secure the network and guarantee consensus. Secondly, the ETH will be released in tranches and not all at once so it will trickle back into markets rather than flood them.

From a price perspective, fundamentals are not usually factored in during bear market conditions so it is unlikely that ETH prices will surge when the Merge takes place. Some industry experts are of the opinion that the Merge will be bullish for Ethereum prices, but only time will tell.

Doge shits wild though. people also value utility and BNB is pretty big in that regard. Fuckin who knows about DOGE though... Lamenting the lack of fundamental analysis of crypto of all things while at the same time calling doge a pump and dump... BNB=not decentralized

Development if a much more reliable indicator of how a market is heading rather than short term prices. And right now, there‚Äôs a ton of development going on in the market honestly.

There are now giants like Apple and GameStop entering the crypto scene and making waves. That alone will bring tons of new blood to the market along with the fresh money.

Also, chains are starting to become a lot more sustainable which also means that adoption will become more and more prominent over the up coming years. Ethereum is moving over to PoS and new L1s like Concordium learned from the mistakes of Ethereum and implemented ZK proofs directly onto the chain for scaling it. Other chains like Cardano are also focusing on carbon negativity.

Let‚Äôs also not forget that governments are starting to accept Bitcoin as legal tender and many companies and businesses are now accepting crypto payments as well.

Solid projects are using this time to focus on building and development.

I could go on but you get the point.

Indeed, tons of development are happening in the crypto space on a daily basis, we really just have to pay attention to see that and stop crying over short term prices, for those that believe and are invested in real projects with long term viability.

 I have been hearing more about the hash-graph, claimed-ly third gen DLT, which, also claimed-ly, solves a lot of the problems associated with blockchains like energy efficiency, transaction throughput and high fees, while maintaining (an even higher) level of security (asynchronous byzantine fault tolerant) and introducing a characteristic known as ""fairness"" to the distributed ledger (the idea that you cant just pay a higher fee to have your order get processed first because a miner chooses to add your transaction to the block first).

A snip from their website as follows:

[Hash graph 3rd gen DLT](https://preview.redd.it/zg28dabfalb71.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=5499aa8b84a7a36e8d5922ef310911aebfb01e98)

I tried to do my due diligence, to understand what the fundamental differences were. Here is actually a decent video, explaining the ""gossip-about-gossip"" and ""virtual voting"" protocol which is implemented and presented by the designer of hashgraph. I think if you watch to the end and understand what a round, witness and famous witness are, you're probably there!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgwYU1Zr9Tg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgwYU1Zr9Tg)

Most of the criticisms I have come across is the fact that it is not completely decentralized. While my understanding could definitely be wrong, I understand that distributed ledger component is decentralized while governance is ""centralized"". I put that in quotes because the reasoning (provided by the founder of hashgraph) behind having a governance board also kind of made sense in my mind. To reword in my own words, Leeman (the founder of hashgraph) claims that anonymous governance (in which you always have incentive to govern) will result in consolidation and collusion by select individuals and result in centralization of governance. i.e. You cannot be sure that governance is decentralized if you don't know who is governing, especially if they have the incentive to govern the network. However, if you choose a large group of governing bodies (likes of IBM, google, etc.) distributed across the globe, all of which have reputations to lose (almost like staking their reputations), and all governance correspondence is publicly available then you have a ""safer""-""decentralization"". You can here it from the man himself here:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ty9Q7B5Hl8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ty9Q7B5Hl8)

[governing council](https://preview.redd.it/lj07cpalalb71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f8904abdd7d3b71f4c7d33d8512ffb8308cab45)

I don't have a strong opinion on this governance perspective, either way could make sense, however, this is still not a criticism of the technology itself (i.e. the gossip-about-gossip and virtual voting algorithms) which to my understanding, give it its speed, efficiency and ""fairness"". If indeed the main criticism is centralized governance, is anything stopping a decentralized governance of a similar gossip-about-gossip and virtual voting type based distributed ledger?

1,Keep your coins off centralized exchanges,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/swb0zy/keep_your_coins_off_centralized_exchanges/,"
Seriously, I can't stress this enough, more and more countries are making cryptocurrency related rules, your coins at risk of being locked away or confiscated from you, all from a single law. Centralized exchanges are forced to comply with these rules, you could lose all your crypto in any time.


 You may be wondering where do I put my coins in. What's the alternative to centralized exchanges you may ask. The answer is simple. You need to have a crypto wallet to store your coins.There are some apps on android, IOS, windows and others, make sure your DYOR to get the right one. As the saying goes : ""Not your keys, not your coins"". And even better, store it in a hardware wallet if you have a large sum of money in crypto. And then you have to try decentralized finance or DeFi for short. You can look into the well known ones like Aggregated Finance, PankakeSwap or Aave. 



In conclusion, not your keys not your coins, so store your coins on hard wallets and try out DeFi instead of using centralized exchanges.",47,29,False," It's the safest way by far. Has an exchange ever locked up a bunch of accounts because of a new law? Usually and from my own experience the exchanges give you a far enough warning that there is a new law and you will either need to close a position or move your coins.

Edit: just read that the Canadian gov is requesting a lock up of accounts. So I guess if you plan on fighting your government probably best not to use a CEX No. 

The majority of users aren‚Äôt tech savvy enough to be using most of the dexs. Having to swap your money around four times just to get a coin that will pair with the one you want is a headache most aren‚Äôt going to want to have. This whole ""nOt uR kEyS nOt Ur cRyPto"" thing is an old dumb narrative. 

Years ago, when Bitcoin was tough to buy there were sketchy exchanges. That is why people say this. Today if you are using a shitty weird exchange you are an idiot. There are so many established ones out there right now. The security features are more what any bank I have ever had gives out. People who are new to crypto need to feel comfortable with this or else there will never be major adoption. To scare new people even more gives crypto a tougher hill to climb. You got a way better chance of you ledger getting lost or broken than Coinbase getting hacked. Stop spreading FUD..the accounts were limited to certain groups in Canada and not all.. I‚Äôm always ready to push the sell button at any given point any given day. So no Perhaps this is a good idea. You can keep some of them in CEXs of course, but not all. Also new DEXs like glimmerswap emerging with super-cheap transaction fees would probably solve the problem of high cost of transactions. So, yeah. I think I agree. I‚Äôm not sure the answer is simple for everyone. most people aren‚Äôt custodians of their own money. Exchanges provide an easy means of transaction. That said, probably not a bad idea to have a cold storage wallet in your possession should you need to withdraw. Better still, try out privacy protocols that offer the options for private balance. 

OP is right, Having your coins on a CEX in an unpredictable time like this is not the best. 

I know Railgun is bringing privacy into DeFi. Privacy and DeFi together sound like the perfect ingredients to keep your wallets out of risk. That's right, DeFi is the best thing to explore right now. Unfortunately, many people don't even know where and how to get started. I'm well familiar with Aave and Curve and it's super dope for those who know how to play the game well. But for those who don't, better to stay in the queue in wait for Spool. From what it is pitched to do, it automatically routes deposits through yield generating protocols and compounds deposits accordingly. In any case, DeFi is still the direction to turn to. There are pros and cons to centralised and decentralised exchanges, which is the basis for our company Quantex. We allow people to choose whether or not they keep custody of their funds by simply using our swap platform, or they can choose to store their funds on our exchange by using our trading platform (coming soon). Yep. Be aware of CEXs. Not every one of them can be fully trusted. To be honest, if you really have a lot in crypto, just get a ledger. I have all my BTC, ETH, Ocean Protocol and eMoney NGM there.",0.9966

Fundamentals Analysis In Crypto Is The Same As Everywhere Else

I have spoken many times about the necessity for investors of all types to concern themselves with the analysis of fundamentals. Speculators, of course, have different imperatives and follow immediate market trends. But an investor is asking ‚Äúwhere can this go next month, next year and beyond?‚Äù This requires examining the foundations of a product, service or concept and asking how solid they are in themselves, compared to others, and in the context of the market as a whole.

In writing first article about trading strategy in cryptocurrency I was tempted to pick a case study in the field, dissect it, and call it a day. However, I have been very active in the comments across general and trading Reddits for crypto in the last few weeks, and I am not convinced such an approach would give us the necessary distance to see the big picture. It is too easy for people to get stuck on details that confirm or challenge their existing bias, through no fault of their own, when what we want to do as traders is build a framework to apply to many use cases.

Therefore we are going to do a real case study, far from the cryptocurrency comfort zone, that is *equally* applicable to any analysis of company, community or service in this space. Bear with me. Take time to consider the problem, approach and resolution. We are always running in circles in this modern world, but as an investor we need to pause and digest. So here we go.

Until the day before yesterday I held 54 different securities (stocks) in the US markets and 1 intermediate term bond product. On that day I added my 55th stock. We are going to examine how and why that happened. Grab some coffee.

By the way, if I delve into something you know, feel free to skip ahead. My purpose is not to be patronizing, but to ensure people who really are new to this space don‚Äôt get lost. A pet peeve of mine has always been when authors don‚Äôt take the time to try and help all types of reader get something valuable.

There is a point in your portfolio when you want to balance things and seek diversity. This can be as simple as choosing products like Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that cover entire market segments and therefore spread your bets in a manner mathematically likely to provide reasonable results. Indeed, mathematically an ETF for the S&P 500 and another for the whole US market will provide you with result equal to or better than traditional hedge funds. But I digress and we don‚Äôt need to talk about hedge funds today.

An ETF is traded like a stock and is an ownership product. By that, I mean the ETF is a financial product made from a basket of stocks. You buy into the ETF, you buy into this basket. You do not get voting rights in any of the company stocks the ETF owns, but many regard that as a fine compromise for the diversity. You have probably heard of the crypto ETFs. It‚Äôs that.

However, many investors do their own thing with regards actually buying and owning stocks. I am one of those investors, though I *also* hold ETF stocks. I‚Äôm diversified. 

When it comes to buying stocks you have some overarching choices. 

You can choose value stocks (they tend to pay reasonably high dividends but the stock is not likely to soar in value) or you can choose growth stocks (they tend to pay low or no dividend, but the stock is likely to increase in value significantly). An example of the former is IBM. An example of the latter is Apple. I own both. Diversified.

Beyond the splice of value or growth stocks, you can choose sectors and geographies. We are not going to touch on geography in this article because it is not super relevant to our discussion right now (I hold companies in the US, UK, Netherlands and Japan). We *are* going to talk about sectors. The obvious lights the way: consumer technology, automotive, cloud, consumables, oil, defense, aviation and so on. 

If we want an analogue to cryptocurrency to anchor us for a moment, think about how Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Monero and Cardano represent different types of segment or sector at this point in time. But don‚Äôt get stuck on this, or forward-facing news like Ethereum 2.0. It‚Äôs not relevant for what we are doing in this article. Remember, we are working on an intellectual framework.

Now, my portfolio has consumer technology, automotive, cloud, consumables, oil, defense, aviation and so on. Diversified. But I am not in every sector and that presents both an opportunity and a challenge. When you enter any new sector you need to learn it, you need to assess it, and you need to make a judgement call. Things can go wrong in each of these stages.

It is certainly harder to assess a new sector than build out in an old one. *However*, if you just dig down into what you know, you can be missing opportunities and you can be increasing your exposure to cyclical downturns. A cyclical downturn is what cryptocurrency markets are learning about, but we have been dealing with for hundreds of years in securities. Sometimes a whole sector drops. And sometimes it rises. And it tends to keep doing that.

Er, that‚Äôs why we diversify.

So, I wanted to do that with a small segment of my portfolio. I was clear about what I wanted to do. First, identify an opportunity in a market *adjacent* to something I already knew. Second, make sure that opportunity provided a dividend (I am in a dividend mood). Third, make sure that opportunity was in a market segment that had a runway of potential growth for five or more years ahead.

This is actually always the first step before looking at assets. There are *tons* of securities and now tons of cryptocurrencies. You want to know what you are looking for before you open the books, turn on the screens, and start casting your eyes at candidates. Triage. 

In my case, I have recently been buying out stakes in various oil companies in the US, UK and Netherlands. I am a huge advocate and investor in next generation technology, but there are solid investment reasons to have holdings in oil majors. One, we are still using a ton of oil. Two, most of the oil majors are not oil majors anymore. They are broad-spectrum energy companies.

Digression: BP (I own this stock) has some excellent solar, wind and hydrogen initiatives. I‚Äôm most bullish about solar and wind, but I appreciate their multi-decade investment in hydrogen fuel station technology. Storing and distributing that fuel is a significant challenge.

Back to the point.

What is adjacent to oil, what has a reasonable dividend, and what is likely to have funding for several years ahead? Manufacturing, but I already own packaging. Construction? I have no interest in supporting the REIT (real estate) business while sub-prime is a thing. But wait‚Ä¶ infrastructure construction. It is boring but - especially in the US - it is the subject of significant incoming *long term* government contracts.

Now, if you enter the market with just that thought, you are going to find too many options. As mentioned before, you need to know what you are looking for. I mentioned I am dipping my toes into this new sector. I mentioned I am interested in dividends. And it should be pretty clear by now that I would like this step to be boring but rewarding.

I cast my mind to a minor oil investment I hold called VOC (this is the stock ticker which allows you to search for the company/entity on stock exchanges). VOC owns oil wells, it sells the oil, and it gives a chunk of the returns back to shareholders. That‚Äôs all it does, and it returns about 9% a year doing so.

Yes, something like that would be useful. An energy trust or limited company focused on providing for a space well, but not taking risks. We are talking about the person selling pickaxes during a gold rush rather than the person with not a cent in their pocket but a glint in their eye.

I opened my professional broker account and started exploring peers to VOC. When you have a broker account you have access to tons of market data, company assessments from various sources, and - depending on the service - great ways to get different perspectives. It is trivial to check ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs like VOC but in an adjacent sector.‚Äù

Blueknight Energy Partners (BKEP) stood out. 53 asphalt terminals in 26 states. 4.7% dividend. They just exited a previous diversification into oil (after all, oil is a declining industry, and small companies will fold first). With the US about to embark in the greatest infrastructure drive in generations, a company focused on roads with coverage of over half the states in the nation is *well positioned.*

Their history? Solid, excepting a nasty shock during the COVID pullback. Not surprising. Their governance? Solid. Their share price? Undervalued by most. For some reason Wells Fargo appears to have a negative thing for them, providing a ‚Äúhold‚Äù (not ‚Äúbuy‚Äù or ‚Äúsell‚Äù) guidance. However, they are virtually alone in that. Reuters Stock Analysis provided solid insight into the company fundamentals. Solid.

Digression: Reuters Stock Analysis has nothing to do with what you see on the news service. It is pages of material for each stock. It digs into a whole bunch of different metrics for a company. This ranges from revenue, return of investment, insider share purchasing or sales, and positioning against peers. It is one (of several) deep dives you can get to help consideration of a security.

So, where were we?

There was a diversification goal. It had to be close to something I already knew to minimize research time. It needs to have solid dividends. It needs to have a good five year revenue roadmap. It needs to withstand my eye moving from market to segment to company and *into* the metrics of the company itself. It would preferably be boring. 

You always zoom in, guided by your investor goals. You seek to avoid being distracted.

BKEP continued to stand out. It met all the criteria. And so I bought. But we are not done yet. The question is ‚Äúhow did I buy?‚Äù The answer is ‚Äúwith minimal risk.‚Äù I purchased only 670 USD of the stock to get started, a fractional amount in my portfolio. 

The reason is simple enough: after all that hard work, after determining a course of action, that does not mean you jump right in. That‚Äôs rolling a dice at the very last moment, after we spent all that time *not* rolling a dice. Unless you are utterly confident that this stock, at this moment, is priced exactly according to your portfolio goals, you use dollar averaging. You buy some now. You buy some later. You ideally do this on a schedule so you don‚Äôt get distracted by the market moving up and down.

And there we have it. I *like* the stock I purchased. It fit my investment profile and passed my tests, most of which were really about ‚Äúhow solid is this thing when I look at it with a cynical eye?‚Äù It is down 3% since I bought it and that has no bearing on my investment. It just makes it cheaper to buy the next allocation. Like I said, I went through the fundamentals. It passed.

It could still go wrong. I could still lose money. But honestly, it‚Äôs pretty rare when you take an approach such as the above. You lose money when you make bets, and when you buy big. The cautious focus on wealth, not riches, and take their time. I know my investment horizon. 19 years remaining before I retire. Plenty of time to take a few risks, to compound interest, and so on. But not enough time to lose everything. 

Hence‚Ä¶yes, you guessed it. Diversification.

Thanks for reading. Let‚Äôs end it there. I hope you take a moment to consider how this process fits into cryptocurrency. It may appear alien, it may strike you as the ‚Äúold way‚Äù of doing things. You may even think things will be completely different in this space. But investors such as myself have heard this many, many times for many hundreds of years. 

As Cicero said, those who remain ignorant of history will forever remain children. I suspect he was being quite condescending at the moment when he spoke, but the wisdom in the comment lies in this simple observation: history can teach us about what happened in this context before, preferably before we make avoidable mistakes or miss catchable opportunities.

Crypto today has proven to be an evolution rather than a revolution. The item we invest in changes, but the reality of investment, economics and human dynamics do not.

Good luck out there, particularly as you look at crypto opportunities, and you consider the fundamentals for yourself, for the economy and for what is being proposed.",3,3,False," Not.

Crypto markets are chaotic due to no regulations and small investments and small selling are possible due to the low fees.

So many more people can play on the market than on the stock market. Millions of people with small amounts can generate big movements up and down.

Moreover the rates are displayed in real time for everybody, whereas stocks have a delay of 15 minutes. Only the professionals have real time prices for stocks.",-0.73

1,Determining the value of low market cap crypto currency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/rvcqty/determining_the_value_of_low_market_cap_crypto/,"This is something I've been looking at for the last month. Some of these can be scams or are just plain gambling. I also think they can serve a purpose of hedging larger investments if you find one that is worth while. The fundamentals behind these tokens that make them worth while are seen regularly but having them all in one project seems to be rare.

It's important for these investments to have an active organic community. Most of these new low market cap crypto currency's are filled with bots. Investing in a token that is filled with bots is just throwing your money at something hoping a project gains traction. This is essentially gambling as a community with real humans actively believes in the project and the utility behind it.

Utility is another important factor when investing in these tokens. If the project has no utility it will inevitably lead to a pump and dump. As price rises the investors will begin to question the value of the token. If there is no value (utility) people will begin exiting there position in mass once the price starts to take massive leaps. This doesn't mean the token has to be Ethereum's replacement but it has to have some use case. This could be NFT's, games, or a meme platform. These alone don't personally show a lot of value to me but sometimes these tokens have bigger dreams than that. This is when I believe the token is a diamond in the rough. A good dev team will consider this before the launch of the token and be transparent about the future.

The dev team is the most important aspect of any project. Having dev's that you recognize from other projects or have a positive reputation is a good sign that you've found something worthwhile. Dev's not only create and improve the project itself but also help market the project to help get it off the ground. When dev's are active in the community and helping it grow organically alongside the community its a good sign. This is another reason these low market cap crypto currency turn into pump and dumps. The same as no utility, if the community doesn't trust the dev team, they will make whatever money they were aiming to make and exit their position.

For a crypto currency to maintain its community and progress into a real project like SHIB, DOGE, and SAFEMOON. I believe it needs all of these fundamentals simultaneously. If one is missing people will lose faith and get out in mass. If you choose to get into these please remember to DYOR and that even a good project at a low market cap can be high risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose because in this space even if something ticks all the boxes it can potentially go to nothing.

I forgot to mention. It's a scam if a few wallets hold a significant amount of the token or if there is some reason you can't sell the token after you buy it. Non scam's will allow you to sell whenever you want. Also, look at the chart, these tokens are not different from any other investing. There will be corrections, if a chart is looking too green over a long period be careful.",67,1139,False," Are these low market cap coins on CoinMarketCap? Or do you find them somewhere else? Nice write-up, I agree with a lot of it. I don't agree however that if a coin has some large wallets it's automatically a scam. Look at Banano that is fully mined but a large portion of the coins are being distributed freely and fairly through faucets, games, folding for proteins etc.. In that case you need to research who the dev team is, what the plan for distribution looks like and decide if you trust the project.

And also just about any new token can be a scam, unless you're a dev, good luck finding that little glitch in the code that let's the liquidity slowly (or rapidlyüò¨) leak out of a back door. Be ready to lose everything you invest in any project. Well put How to identify a ponzi? Anything which has animal names, shib, moon, Elon, cum and other crap. Make your money in a Ponzi all you want but 90% of the times you will be burnt. Great article I got into shib early as a way to hedge my bets against a down trend in my long term crypto investments. Some of these more risky investments have really pushed me back into my comfort zone while the over all trend of crypto was starting to look bearish. Great work again. Shibonk, the community is incredible. The dev is a founding dev of shiba inu and active organic growth. Biggest gem I‚Äôve found in a while. LFG üöÄ A lot of attention is being channeled into web3 protocols now. 
DEIP is a web3 protocol that tokenizes intangibles in the form of fractionalized NFTs Great read OP. I have a couple lowcaps I am into that are applying the contents of your post. Bank$ and SHIBO are 2 of my faves. Excited to see these grow and what new coins come out. Again.. Simple. Memescoins are the new economy. There I said it. Bonk #shibonk $shibo Alex Becker did a good video on micro caps I‚Äôm holding a few bsc meme coins Shibo, MAKA and BROS Sorry for the noob question but how does one check to see if a majority of a coin is being held only in a few wallets? Thank you. That is a good post. With utility I also add the niche in which the project is playing. For ex, Rario NFTs, is a cricket sports marketplace. Seeems small right? No, it's a 2.5B fans sport, yet, considered a niche. Crazy. ‚ÄúA real project like shib doge and safemoon‚Äù where‚Äôs the comedy flair? I don't know if this is a raid or what but good work I guess lol. I got myself some Shibo! Have a look at shibonk Shibonk is a great new token. Only 1.5 months old. We just got listed today on coin market cap and coin gecko. Awesome community. Wouldn‚Äôt hurt to check our telegram. SHIBONK TO THE MOON! >like SHIB DOGE or safemoon

yeah very pondered One thing I also look at is whether they have a VC partner like Arrington Capital. Not only do they seem to have an eye for backing projects with great potential, they just don't fund any project without doing their own research the potential utility and development team that started it. When I see projects have such backing, it gives me more confidence that its a safer investment than others that might not have such backers. Stock is an investment that represents a share, or partial ownership, of a company. Stocks are one of the best ways to build wealth. The liquidity mining systems established by POP are improved, draw mass adoption, and attract liquidity providers to spend their tokens. [removed]",0.9989

There's a million ways to do something and the way that you are currently using is not the only one come on there could always be a better way, or there could always be something you could learn from someone else.

This is especially the case in the world of cryptocurrency, where they are thousands of ways to do something. For example if you wanted to enter this taking world there are hundreds and hundreds of ways to do it. You could do it on major platforms or on some small programmes. This is also the case where if you wanted to borrow money many platforms will offer it but each will have its own way to pay it back.

For me I used to trade a lot of small coins, and this is where I learned that it makes a big difference where you actually do it. If you do it on some small and tiny platform than there is a major risk of getting the rug pulled from beneath you. And it has happened to me before. Even if your research the project well there is always the probability that the founders will get tempted by major profits and scam everyone.

And that's why some platforms have went as far as to offer literal insurance funds, such as the case with so·∏∑ana prime, because as hard as you vet the coin, you can't trust human greed.

1,Millennials do not believe in banks and stock markets - they like digital technologies and cryptocurrencies more. This will fundamentally change the global financial system.,https://cryptogeek.info/blog/the-richest-americans-will-become-crypto-investors-by-2030,,268,73,False," Nice click bait. I believe in stocks and crypto. You‚Äôll be a fool to believe in just one. As a millennial, don‚Äôt believe in pension, social security, loans and the ever growing taxes. Believe in the first two Um, no. I believe in making my money working for me in a balanced portfolio. One built of stocks, bonds, retirement savings AND crypto. Crypto is my smallest allocation. What a load of shit. 

I have more cash in the stock market, mutual funds and savings have I have in crypto and I‚Äôm a millennial. 

I‚Äôm actually bearish on crypto long-term despite the fact that Blockchain will become the gold standard for supply chains. Crypto and blockchain are NOT the same thing. We asked our financial advisor to invest in only ‚Äòsocially responsible‚Äô companies/stocks.  He said we were the 1st to ask him to do that. millenials do not believe in DIGITAL MONEY. they only believe in DIGITAL MONEY So much bs is posted on this sub, and people overuse millennials way too much I‚Äôm a gen Z. I don‚Äôt trust banks but it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to miss out on profits because the boomers aren‚Äôt dead yet. Stocks will be reliable until they aren‚Äôt and we haven‚Äôt seen that point yet. Yet I‚Äôm already stocked up on CC and buying more but that‚Äôs not my get rich quick scheme As a millennial, I‚Äôm morally opposed to rampant speculation in general. What‚Äôs the point in having an entire class of people in society doing nothing but staring at line graphs on a screen? Swing trading is so lucrative that they don‚Äôt even need real jobs anymore. They‚Äôre not producing anything of value to the real economy. It‚Äôs gambling, which is labeled a vice for good reason. You want this country to remain competitive? Promote meritocracy and give people a motivation to produce economic output. Being that the stock market is now a tool for fascists I‚Äôm not surprised. Fuck this passive income nonsense. You people are the reason why America is a failed state. They‚Äôre printing money to appease you to the detriment of our society. You don‚Äôt get to profit from doing nothing. It‚Äôs not natural and not sustainable. It's all digital to me once it's a number in my investment app or banking app. It's no longer a tangible asset in my personal possession. Whether it be IRA, 401K, stocks, crypto, savings, checking, etc. It‚Äôs all one giant inflated bubble off the back of a heavily debased currency that will continue to prop all asset classes giving people a false sense of wealth Unless more financial institutions offer crypto along with mutual funds/GICs... 99% of people can't even figure out what crypto is, let alone how to acquire it. There‚Äôs a United States Dollar coin (USD) on the crypto market.... now why would that be.... Millennials will be more inclined to buy crypto coins than previous generations.

That's for sure.

However, that doesn't mean you should put all your eggs in one basket.

You have to be pragmatic and diversify with some real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc ... I‚Äôm a millennial and I believe in banks, there‚Äôs two near my house Ha millennials? The majority are too broke to move out of their parents house. Not that it‚Äôs entirely their fault but you‚Äôre nuts if your think millennials are throwing their money into Crypto. The comments on this thread spoke my mind exactly. Nice crypto shill though... but no. Strange headline. Crypto is supposed to be a currency/store of value, not a productive dividend-earning earning asset. In the long run it won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt replace stocks. Crypto will likely become a mainstream part of forex trading, but that‚Äôs different. Millennials will likely move towards both, not either/or. I really don‚Äôt think even a small subset of millennials see crypto as an alternative to stocks/bonds.",0.9788

1,Would you advise a newbie to invest in memecoins?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/syxxlc/would_you_advise_a_newbie_to_invest_in_memecoins/,"Before I start this is a serious post so please no trolls.

So, I wouldn‚Äôt call myself a veteran, but I am also not a newbie. I Joined in the late 2018s and I wasn‚Äôt very serious back then. I only bought a tiny bit of stable coins and put some money into BTC and ETH. I thought I would only be holding for the very long term. 

With time I started gaining some confidence and would try my hand at ‚Äútrading‚Äù. I would buy low and sell high and whatnot. Was a somewhat stressful moment in my life.

Then I had a friend introduce me to memecoins. It was honestly both a blessing and a curse. I did end up losing quite a lot on some memecoins at first because I would just ape in without any research, but there were other coins like ELON that seriously made me bank. I was not used to seeing a x100 before, so seeing ELON do it in late 2021 was the highlight of my year. 

Now my question is would any of you actually advise a newbie to get into memecoins? The only reason I got into it is because of my friend, so im curious to see what you guys think.",2,19,False," It really depends...  


If you're looking for some quick cash sure, but If you want a long-term investment you need to look for memecoins with utility, like Dinger for example. No doubt, Elon is a solid meme coin, and I buy into it solely to profit because most will likely die out quickly. I feel solid projects that solve or have real use cases will be around for a longer time, NII for instance will be around as long as Ethereum's high gas fees are not addressed in a timely manner. I wouldn‚Äôt advice anyone to gamble on memecoins.

‚ÄûInvest‚Äú lol For a long term investment? No. A quick pump and dump? Maybe. But, I'd still suggest projects that are actually backed by investors like Au21 capital and/or GAINZ like DVDX. Even ones like AVAX that you know is long term. In my experience, avoid. The reason I say this is look at tokens that have an actual purpose in the real world. There's no guarantees to profit in any investment but atleast pick something with foundation, unless you want to lose. With the memecoins there's allot of risk from rugpulls, which is quite common... but you invest in what way you thinks best, dyor! To be honest I don't see the fundamentals most Meme coins are built upon. Most of them are just for short term money grabs. If you just started investing you can stick to the top 100, research and pick your dish. As for myself I love to invest in projects with real life use case that  are built on strong fundamentals like DOT, DIA, SOL, LUNA, OIN and the like. I like delayed gratification, I'm not in a hurry. Definitely not gonna advice anyone I care about to go into memes. I've been here for a while and I know just how crazy volatile that market is. There's lots of other tokens out there. There's good Metaverse and DeFi projects around with great utility and higher protection. Recently, I was telling a friend about HyperdexFinance and how secure it is to do your trading there. They've already been Certik audited, platform to go live from next month and have even got mentioned on several places including a Forbes magazine. Why go for a meme coin when you've got something like that? Absolutely not, there are cheap fundamentals in the space with usecases good enough to go 100x in the shortest time and polkadot got some of the best like PNODE,POLS and UDO. Cryptocurrency wasnt created with memecoins in mind. Going into memecoins may not be a bad place to start for a newbie, but I would rather invest in promising low caps like PKR, CVP, and RIN and have them staked than go into memecoins. I've heard of guys making money through investing in memecoins, but these cases are rare. I won't advice investing in memecoins because they can easily get one rekt. I'd rather invest in low capped coins; DKT, SYLO, SPOOL, ICONS etc are good ones to start with. Never! If It  is not any of the crypto with real-life utilities like those use in crypto payment solution including BTC, ETH, EGLD, UTK and others, then it's not advisable even for a diamond hand. Best to invest in projects with good fundamentals if you're thinking of holding for the long term. Memecoins might be attractive, largely because of the hype around some of them, so if at all you want to get some, you should only invest a small amount of money, to help guard against the hype not leading to a pump of the memecoin.    

Conversely, only a small amount of money is needed to get into presales/TGEs of solid projects. It worked for me when I got into Kda. Now, I intend to get into Subsquid's token launch event using the same playbook. Investing in meme coins is one of the riskiest things in crypto. it has cost most newbies their money.

I will advise investing in solid projects with good fundamentals. One of such projects is Nahmii which is at the forefront of web3 development with a recent launched incubator SkunDAO.",0.999

Okay, but did you spend even 30 seconds looking for patterns on graphs where it does that double up, double down pattern, and then tanks further? The answer is no, because if you had done that, you'd have found them.

If you want to be good at technical analysis, you need to spend more time trying to prove your hypotheses *wrong* than trying to prove it *right*. Anyone can find a pattern where the past market did what you want the current market to do, but finding a pattern which is actually able to predict where the market will go is much more difficult.

Also, technicals are nice, but what's your fundamental analysis? Both are useful, but if I had to pick just one to do, it would definitely be fundamental analysis, not technical analysis. My fundamental analysis right now is that the recent bull market was driven largely by remote workers who had disposable income and nothing to do with it because of the pandemic, so they put it into crypto. But now a lot of those remote workers have quit their jobs, and as things open up they're going out and spending money on things again, and both of those factors mean they're pulling their money out of crypto so they can spend it. Additionally, inflation is *wild* right now, meaning that people are pulling money out of crypto just to pay for the things they need that have gone up in price. None of this looks good for crypto.

My biggest bet is on LRC, dyor I am convinced that there is a lot of room for growth in the decentralised Content Delivery Network with some projects like Theta and AIOZ. 

With AIOZ coming at a time where content powerhouses are looking to having exclusive control over their content, a decentralised network makes it much easier. Mainstream platforms like YouTube would have to watch their backs in few years because the impending growth of this technology. CRO. Well thought out eco system. Great marketing.

The point potential failure is far in the rear view mirror. The nature of all dapps that do things that are meaningful and provide value in the real world economy all require oracles to feed their native smart contracts. Each dapp using the chainlink network feeds the value of the link token as each individual one grows and utilizes more and more data. The link token is uniquely setup to grow from the success of all other projects. There is no other coin in comparison other than ethereum, and other networks. However ethereum is already valued much higher, and all other networks are not necessarilly going to be around for a long time considering most of them have like no dapps Harmony ONE Everyone is jumping the ADA ship right before many DApps such as sundae swap, Adax, meld, cardax etc. Deploy on the front end.

Rastaswap. 

Rastaswap is an exchange that is launching march 1st, ICO december 1st. Rastaswap's token is called $Rcoin. The purpose of Rastaswap is to tokenize stock options of cannabis related companies and start ups, so that more people can invest and access all over the world. Cannabis is restricted in some countries so stocks are not an option either, but this opens the door for the rest of the world to invest in an exponentially growing cannabis industry!  

ICO price is .11 USD, there will be a maximum of 160million tokens. Finally, holders will receive daily dividend rewards of either $ETH $BNB or $CAKE at 4:20 PM (amount depending on how much you hold and daily volume). The Telegram community is great too! Only place to go is up!!!!!!!! BAT with Brave browser. You can get paid just to use your browser. It's awesome, and you can even tip people on reddit or other websites if they have a creator account setup. They have video calling through the browsers, integrated wallets, and really good add blocking too without any extensions. I use the browser on my phone and can go on Youtube and not have any adds.

Also LRC looks really good with the anticipation of their new counterfactual wallet and next layer functionality to reduce gas fees. Trac for the millionth time.

No one shills it on here because we're all busy filling our bags.


See you at $30. Fight me. Take a look at DCIP.  It is a DeFi investment fund.  Upfront taxes go in part to funding an investment pool and community members make proposals and vote on investments to make with that pool.  Distributions of gains are made to holders when an investment is liquidated and the person that proposed the investment gets a 2.5% additional share of the profits.  

It is a really unique business model with a great community and a lot of potential.  It is very early.  Market cap is under $15mm and they are just kicking off marketing.  They are also about to roll out a fiat in-ramp.  I think there is a lot of upside here. NANO, big things ahead partnered with a big startup  recently which Jayz has invested in. Fantom. Lrc SCRT the price to supply ratio is insanely low for what it does. Quant (QNT) AMP, ONE, CRO, CKB 
EverGrow Coin 

Deflationary asset that distributes reflections in BUSD. The reflections are 8% and more than half the circulating supply has been burned already.
They have an anti-whale feature that dosent let whales sell more than 0.125% of the total supply in one transaction.

They also have a Buy-Back and Burn function. When Buy-Back and Burn is enabled, the contract purchases EGC from exchanges, which creates a green handle, then permanently removes those tokens from circulating supply (burn) which makes the $EGC token scarcer over time. More than 1.7% of tokens have already.

**Utilities and dapps**


Some utilities include Nft Marketplace, Nft Lending, Content Creator subscription platform(think Patreon, YouTube, and onlyfans combined. The platform will increase volume and hence reflections). Utilities all coming within next few months.

Supported Exchanges like Bitmart, Lbank, Bibox and many others to coming in the next few weeks.

Compared to almost all other deflationary coins the returns are insanely higher. If you are interested in calculations of reflections based on volume and wanna see crazy return on investment, check this EGC calculator out.

thedipdream.com Metaverse/NFT: Sandbox, Gala, decentraland, bora, axie infinity IOTA on fire recently, check it out Ergo I'd say Loopring. Relatively small marketcap, rumoured collaboration with GameStop and I think a lot of potential. Definitely a lot of room to grow. Jasmy seems to have potential ü§î TRIAS CRO and HOT RNDR. Great team. Professional project and website. Decentralized GPU rendering. With the advent of the metaverse boom this has even more upside i think. 

There‚Äôs a short video of the ceo explaining the project on the website. Check it out $XPR $LOAN Glitch Protocol (GLCH). Super agnostic L1 designed SPECIFICALLY for DeFi. Transfer speeds conservatively clocked at 3000 TPS. Delegated Proof of Stake with a unique shared revenue model across the entire ecosystem. Supports several dev languages to build Dapps, to include Solidity, C++, GoLang, Javascript, to name some. Launchpad already a proven success with Gpool launch.

I can't tell you enough on how much potential this gem has and if you check the charts you'll see exactly what I mean. have learnd of a sorcery in a diferent post regarding some magic leters called ALGO?...!?! wonder if it works Gala, GALA. XYO, XYO. Harmony, ONE. Siacoin, SC. Contentos, COS. VVS Fiance, VVS.

Cheap, have potential. Not much of a gamble with a lot of upside. I called Loopring, LRC months ago because of utility, not hype. Marketcap,  potential for adoption/utilization, blockchain it is on.

All blockchains are relevant. Just know how and why or stick with what you know. Not financial advice. It's still early. Always time to find a gem. FOMO on nothing. Just find the next one. Always more to come in this world of crypto.

Biggest advice, listen/read what other peers say. Good and bad. Read a reddit debate on a coin/token or blockchain. Differing opinions are very important.

Chainlink, Polygon, MATIC, BAND for more stable(ish). I'm confident DIA will outperform other data management projects. I'm not bothered about recent price movement, we will eventually see it pump because it is a project with great utility. 
Recent integrations and partnerships are testament to the fact.

Another project I'm convinced about its growth is Legends of Elumia. A GameFi that will give players 100% ownership over their characters and items. I anticipate its launch

The gaming space has a bright future and I hope everyone is ready for what's to unfold.

Invest wisely! EGC EGC, our subreddit /r/evergrowcoin, already has 17k members and the project is only 2 months old. Also the first project to pay reflections in a stable coin (BUSD). Evergrow.  Serious team, serious potential. NKN EGC and Reflecto INJ has potential to be the best DEX. Backed by Binance Multi vac, Digibyte RNDR coin. ""Rendering the metaverse."" A decentralized computing network that renders any project and it works right now. Freakin Beeple uses it. It will be used as a decentralized version of AWS. AWS is worth 500 billion. RNDR is at 1 billion market cap.

Render 3d, 4k videos on your iPhone, no more need for centralized computing power. Holy sh** this is the future. My wallet agrees. Algorand, Yieldly, Cro and LRC. And eth Seeing CRO, LRC, and TRAC. Are there any cryptos out there that are at the .10 mark or less that we should all be looking at? 

Trying to get way ahead of the curve as I sure we are all interested in doing. I'm following two projects that have the same ""idea"" and ""goal""

The projects are OPCT Opacity Storage and RNB Rentible, the idea is ""an easy to use approach"" and the ""goal' is the mass adoption of service and platform. 

1) OPCT Opacity Storage is a private cloud storage provider. Focused on privacy (no e-mail, password and personal informations are required for use it), it has an already great product. 

Opacaty can also be a bridge for other decentralized storage project. Indeed Team will soon release Siacoin Integration. 

In the next weeks will be released also the Mobile App and I think that it will be a gate for a mass adoption of the service (service that you can also try for free) 

Market cap around 50Million (very low compared to its competitors such as Filecoin) 

2) Rentible RNB 

A first-mover dApp for mid-to-long term property rentals, where tenants and landlords can send/receive rent payments in different cryptocurrencies

For me is a game changer for mid-to-long term rent. Platform is ready to start in December in Latam countries. 

You can stake it on Bancor or Uniswap

Rentible will also add a marketplace for rent metaverse properties. 

Market can insane! Only 6 million Usd BAN

Velas is definitely worth a consideration. It‚Äôs a fork of Solana. Even if you don‚Äôt like Solana that should be a decent indicator of potential price. Trading around $.45 JASMY! Jasmy. LRC. CRO. XRP. AMP? Thanks for making this platform for discussion. The area that I am focused on investing is in crypto investor protections. There‚Äôs a new token, about 1 month old, and they are developing an entire ecosystem of investor protection dApps!

Cat-apult will be the launchpad used for others looking to launch meme tokens where they can go to get kyc verified by our team, and get assistance on the technical side of launching their token.

D-Lock is the liquidity locker. Every new token will be required to lock up a liquidity pool for at least a year, protecting the earliest investors in the project by ensuring they always have access to a market to buy or sell!

Cat-iversity will be the education platform where there are beginner courses offered for free, and more advanced blockchain courses like how to read etherscan, how to interact with DEX‚Äôs, how to execute an arbitrage strategy, etc will be offered and can be paid in the native ecosystem currency.

As well as an arcade style gaming platform, and an insurance fund to protect investors that engage in the ecosystem!

The token is called the Dinger token, and was actually inspired by Elon musks cat Schrodinger, however the project is aiming at building so much more than ‚Äújust your other meme‚Äù. The community refers to the platform as ‚ÄúThe Rug Killer‚Äù and I‚Äôm very excited to see what the team announces during their voice chat with the community this upcoming Saturday.

Let me know if you have any questions :) MIST metaverse JASMY and MATIC have room to run. DYOR, I hear it‚Äôs a great coin if you get in now KDA WAXP SAND LUNA someone know some cibersecurity proyect?

im really interested in a blockchain that can perform security activitis, but in cmc , the top 1 last update was in 2020.. I can tell you $HANU from Goji Crypto. DYOR SaaS platform and much more. #GojiSwap #GojiBridge #GojiPay #GojiFaaS #GojiLock #GojiSaaS 

[Goji Crypto website ](https://www.gojicrypto.com/) Gonna go all in with ACH - Alchemy Pay! Had a big coinbase pump, drew in a bunch of investors, has a limited supply and the dev team is announcing partnerships like crazy right now. They are angled to bridge FIAT and Crypto and partner with Binance, Shopify and Visa, so I'd jump on that now if I were you. UFO Morpheus.Network! MNW SPE (saveplanetearth), doesnt get noticed cause People think its a charity but it isnt. OLT and PLANETS, I'm bullish on both. Take a look at  Planets chart recently, as btc and others fell/fall, planets continues to rise. When people buy the ""miners"" for Planet tokens, they have to buy a license which they have to pay for using Planets token, the more people start mining, the more planets they have to buy and so on.
Its only listed on 2 exchanges at the moment, if Kucoin and binance list it, that would cause a price increase alone (speculation). The idea behind the project is really good, it's all about the environment (measuring air quality) and we all know anything good for the environment is a winner these days.

At the time or writing the price is $0.47, I'm in at $0.35-0.47, I'll continue to buy until it hits $1. I fancy PNT alot in the cross-chain interoperability sector and it definitely still has so much room for growth in this space. ADA ü§£üò≠ Bitcoin. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] Polyswarm, not even close. ELU from Legends of Elumia is one I think will boom in the gaming space.

It's gaining in sats when lots of the market is down rn. REALM [removed] Hedge finance token TRAC is going to explode in 2022 due to adoption.

SUPDOG will be the meme coin of 2022. $WILD. play the trend. Probably IMX going to be the crypto of steam CRO even before the pump. But also LRC as ganestop and wsb continued pumps. For me definitely STRX. Strikex is worth a look as it is still small and other than all the shitcoin is actually a legit project with a strong team! Just take a look on the website and through the white paper : www.strikex.com .
Alread partnered with chain link and bigger things to come! MicroPETS. What's kept me around during this dip is the pure dedication of the team.  They spend so much money on the project itself. From the high quality nfts to the CERTIK audit to the p2e game by Cubix. The team really keep my faith. $INJ
[Injective Protocol](https://injectiveprotocol.com) Look up SpaceDawgs. Memecoin with utility. CKB and QANX‚ù§Ô∏è GET protocol, ticketing real life events and the metaverse. ""Without all the crap shilling""!!! LMAO holochain, your welcome TRAC Vvs finance just got listed on Crypto.com 
Seems it has a long way up to do XYO - XY Oracle, bridging the physical and blockchain worlds, going to be massive, think of it as VET on steriods Zombie Inu - Zinu. Just look at their Twitter and white pages. 

Not a meme token. Telos, low supply,small market cap, still unknown, evm released, still under 2$. Fast AF. Only a matter of time. EGLD is just getting started. Great developers. On time. Dex just launched and is working well. Personally I think it will get to at least where ETH is now. A risky one (maybd) but look up Zenon (ZNN), Network of Momentum. Iotex

KLIMA Sand will be a tip 10 coin in the next few months. [removed] LRC Cro My new addition is ENS I only go for utility coins / tokens which operate with real fundamentals. Such as:

TRAC - secure data interoperability & data exchange (eg data marketplaces, NFTs, supply chain ecosystems)

NOIA - internet protocol for improving speed, reliability and DevOps independent of any large companies (but they're all going to be using it)

LTO - hybrid public / private blockchain for improving business flow & document anchoring. Launching into improving NFTs soon

QNT - connecting multiple blockchains and presenting them as an abstracted layer that any business can use. r/CasperCSPR When the world discovered Hbar it‚Äôs game over CKB - Nervos Network VVS Finance Two that I am really bullish on :

$XCAD  -   Watch2Earn revolution.   https://xcadnetwork.com/

The tokenising of YouTube content. Where creators can mint their own fan tokens and those fans can earn money for simply watching their favourite YouTubers. 

$OPUL (OPULOUS) - https://opulous.org/

 Opulous brings¬†Decentralized Finance to the music industry, changing how artists access the funding they need and providing a launchpad for the first music¬†copyright-backed NFTs. Curve has been performing  really good  and they have great use case in the lending and borrowing space. VGX on voyager. 1.2B cap. It‚Äôs a banger DIVICOIN. 

I've tracked this for a few years now. The community is one of the best. The tech isn't incredible but their ability to partnership with banks, governments, and other industries is growing. Lots of potential imho OPCT! So long as it has a cute dog logo, the fundamentals are solid.

Real talk though, I think any DeFi/Swap tokens in the Solana ecosystem are going to do very well by the end of the summer. In fact, as a developer, I think Solana will be the preferred chain for most developers by the end of 2023. I‚Äôd elaborate, but I‚Äôm assuming your just here for the trading tips, not the technical stuff. GAME Credits Cosmos PNT - cross chain interoperability will see so much demand in the future. Moving assets cross chain and connecting the different economies will be key for DeFi‚Äôs success and adoption! Also tokenomics are great - market cap is only 39M - lots of room for growth! I am following ERGO as I see huge potential there. The tech is amazing, ErgoDex is live, more good news are coming. CELR network and Oasis ROSE. DYOR Radix is going to turn Crypto on it's head. Clearly Monero Nano has huge potential. Very strong likelihood of FlowHub integrating it into their point of sale software UFO, VRA, DVX, POLC, ALBT, EPIK, TCG2 and KLO

Take your pick $HTR, $FSN, $ALGO, $ONE Recently picked up a bag of $NUM

I think it has alot of potential from it giving people the ability to create NFTs from their own camera roll, I reckon 10x potential but dyor as always nfa Elf token, it actually donates to toys for tots. Toys for tots even tweeted about the donations. Tiz the season, i see it going bullish before xmas Cellframe, similar to Polkadot but with a $72m market cap PLUS being quantum-safe VVS Finance XCM is just like CRP but even better and it‚Äôs so incredibly undervalued.

Loopring is an ethereum‚Äôs layer 2 that has the capability to house a descentralized exchange with minimum fees, provide a counterfactual wallet allowing reduced transaction fees and also allows to put together an NFT marketplace with minimal transaction costa, retiring other actors such as opensea.io. On top of that, they are working with a major partner for the NFT marketplace still unknown, but everything points it is GameStop. DYOR No shill? Cudos I'm absolutely convinced that Railgun still got a lot of room to scale about its range, given the fact that it's a zero-knowledge protocol that got privacy at its heart for both defi and NFTs markets, and this has seen it whitelisted on Bancor and OlypmusDAO. Astronos came out like 3 weeks ago cost $.04 with a supply of only 77 million!!!!! That means if market cap gets to 77 million it‚Äôll be worth a dollar. They are undergoing an audit by certik right now and have a space video game they have short videos on they are making and incorporating there crypto into. Also coming out with swap and mainnet. Huge potential and super early. Burn ASH courtesy of the artist Pak will be the next biggest thing related to the burning of NFT‚Äôs especially now & even more so when they start to become less en Vogue, or trendy!!!

Great for accumulation POP is one coin that will be a magic and bring in value with time, seeing that it‚Äôs a partner validator that uses MLPs to prove commitment. VRA which has 25% APR for staking and also has a lot of room to move up with a market cap under 300m REX 2.0

Interesting to say the least. Worth looking into. Should launch around January.

NFA‚ô•Ô∏è There are many, but from what i am seeing recently i will give you just one idea, so do your research: Unique. I've joined Quartz to get the option to participate in Unique public sale once it's out. Quartz recently secured a parachain slot in kusama. After that, the Unique Network was chosen as exclusive blockchain partner for United Nations. Their NFT marketplace is great, so i am very bullish for this one. Based in my research, this is a true gem and much room to grow once is out. ANKR Saitama Plugin in and Checkdot. I think both these projects have massive potential. I‚Äôm a beta tester for Ultra (UOS). 

It‚Äôs a layer 1 though elevator pitch is ‚Äòcrypto steam‚Äô or ‚ÄòETH of gaming‚Äô. 

They‚Äôve just started announcing some of their gaming content partners - Skybound (The Walking Dead Series), PlugInDigital, Microids, Thunderlotus etc etc. 

One of the great things about the platform is that it‚Äôs built to house traditional games as well as games with heavy NFT integration. So they‚Äôre not cornered into a niche market. 

There‚Äôs obviously a lot more to it. Happy to field any questions. Ergo bih Nft art finance I think LTO network has a lot of potential. Especially in the post-regulalatory future, which is something we need to be aware of when searching for new projects. Bitrise and MarketMove Fuzz.fi on Harmony One

It will bring liquid staking, lending and wagering to Harmony. Fuzz will be needed to create a wagering event and all transactions on Fuzz will burn their token to create deflationary pressure.

It's very small at ~5M market cap, but worth a look Chiliz (CHZ) Here you have a platform  that lets users that let users trade tokens to show support for profesional teams. 
Sports are huge and athletes have even bigger platforms to make this successful. Up 20% today SHIB With all the scams ad rug pulls happening I think insurance in crypto like Bmi would have a huge potential. Every crypto investor wants security in their assets. Lrc I like the team and vision behind ergo. The tech is sound and the use case is realistic. Quant ‚Ä¶ if they do indeed get behind the digital dollar, euro and pound. Plus being able to connect all different crypto types together eventually ie ERC20 to Cosmos. IMX STORJ. 

You‚Äôre welcome. [removed] LRC! IOTA Quantum resistant tokens like Qan would be something to look at as it's utility would enable institutions to build DApps, smart contract and cryptocurrency that is quantum proof. Polymath - Custom blockchain for securities, just launched mainnet following SEC clearance.  Adoption is already getting started with devs building on the network. There's no crap happening. A little correction doesn't hurt. SPDR and many others still look like they have a good leg up. Holding SPDR till ATH or more which is still 5x away. Klima & Time Did you know that the Dexfolio app allows you to track some of your favorite tokens such as ETH, BNB and MATIC?

[deleted] [removed]  I am focused on some underrated projects with a market cap under $50m as NGM and MLT. These two are listed as the most promising projects recently. NGM is the one I hold and stake for a long time already. They are focused to provide an improved payment method with their fully backed &interest-bearing stablecoins. It has the potential to be the next LUNA with its use case and goal. [removed] if 0.06% the market cap of bitcoin is 'room to grow' then the answer is nano.

it does what bitcoin intended but can't.  simple base level function set, has the potential to touch billions of lives and own the digital sov/moe space in perpetuity. take off your crypto safes zone head and think of it as a fintech startup looking to disrupt international banking.

Look it up. Bullish if u ask me Probably someone mentioned this already but Radix. Definitely worth checking out. [removed] [removed] Fundamentals and tokenomics? Nano is hands down the most undervalued in the market. It may remain so for another week, month or year but not holding some is a risk afaic.

130-140 market cap position and beats over other payment coins by a long shot. [removed] ATOM (COSMOS) for sure because of interoperability and non-VC decentralization. With regulations cracking down on cryptocurrencies, I think Panther Protocol \[ZKP\] will be the go to platform by many crypto users

One can do all Defi activities on-chain; privately, While proving compliance as well, without any reveal of underlying data. This isn't only applicable to retails, but also financial institutions

It leverages on zkSNARKs tech, and it's MVP launching on Polygon, will be a disruptive game changer. [deleted] GALA!!! You can always tell these places by the really old product.

Say it with me now,

BA-NA-NO Nano. The market cap is so low‚Ä¶ What about iotex? Anyone? I have my bets on PKR. Low capped gem, and once the Polker game goes live, I expect a lot of green days with PKR.
ICONS look really promising. They had their IDO yesterday, and in a couple of minutes was sold out. The project has a really good use case and lot of utilities. Gro, sub 30 mil market cap, but already has a lot of amazing stuff.  
Just their stable coin MOR already does more than any other stable coin. VeChain. Fastest and feeless I'm convinced that privacy projects like the Secret Network, Oasis, and Panther protocol, as well as Metaverse projects like SAND, ALICE, and GGM, have room to grow in the coming years.

Zero-knowledge technology is what crypto projects are aiming for to improve privacy and define composable, which I believe will create more wave for projects into it, and Metaverse, particularly play to earn, is the new trend. [removed] In DeFi I can't believe how much RAMP is overlooked. They were the first project to use staked assets as collateral, they literally help you get capital for trades without having to sell you assets (you even earn full staking rewards meanwhile). They added stablecoin yield (30% APY autocompounding), will reward users for borrowing (minting rUSD).

All that is missing is awareness now for it to blow up. [removed] NGM and ATOM for me

NGM team will dominate the stablecoin space with their fully backed currency based stablecoins. 5 EU currency pairs has been issued and support for other currency is on the way Hathor, check it out Check out SYLO, low market cap Kucoin gem that still has so much room to grow. With the Sylo node, NFT DAO and tokn burn set to happen before EOY, there's no telling how far it can go. DIA.

This is an oracle and privacy provider gem. I have seen a lot of coin without good use cases and later crashed. But I feel this gem has a lot of potential that is why I am holding up on it. [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] I think QANX has a huge potential in the upcoming year. Mainnet should be launched in Q1 and it will be a hybrid, quantum-resistant, fast, and most developers-friendly blockchain. [removed] [removed] Definitely Nafty. They are building a whole ecosystem with many platforms already live. NFT marketplace, social network, own payment API which supports recurring payments. HUGE potential! naftytoken.com [removed] [removed] AG8 https://twitter.com/oneg8one?s=21 I‚Äôd say SCLP. You get to manage fiat and crypto in one system while staking, trading in exchange, buying NFTs and others. Market cap is just about 60M for now. It‚Äôs relevant in DeFi banking and it‚Äôs supported by  Yahoo, Bloomberg, Nasdaq and some other top companies. Talk of room to grow, SCLP is a good one, they recently launched an app, you can have your fiat and crypto in the same space with SCLP, dyor Stakenet XSN. The main reason I think it's got potential is that it's really technology pioneering. Recently, it's combined Lightning Network and Connext and it's doing transactions in layer 3, it's never happened before. In layer 3, the issue of BTC scalability will be totally resolved. Take a look at BankersDream started by the Bankers - I'm invested into this after my own research. To be frank, not received a better rewards in any other projects except BankersDream. Please DYOR. Are we still there from where we started? Shilling and shilling? We should look at partnerships, active business(read revenue) and most importantly a solid team over anything else. There are more than 17k projects in the market for heavens sake! Sure. Very mature post /s Why don't you just give me your money and I'll invest it for you for a fee :) 

The world of Defi is growing quickly. I suggest you research projects in that area. Gala Games - no doubt the one and only guarentee millionaire maker. Yesterday was starting Town Star NFT Node sale - https://galagames.games/nodes/my-node Zuna coin 100% WAXP - best positioned for NFT growth
SAND - best metaverse environment I've seen
CRO - best exchange for the masses
ZCN - best storage platform for all the nft/metaverse data. Their mainnet will be launching very soon after development since the last cycle. XDC Xinfin network. Only $1.1 Billion market cap, ISO20022 compatible. Main design is to be token used for world trade. Also GBEX which operates on XDC ecosystem. Bitcoin is one gem with strong growth potentials,  but looking away from Bitcoin, we have some Altcoins with a clear-cut road map and fundamentals.

Ethereum,  polygon, Solana have good fundamentals but the one I am bullish on is Syscoin. 

Syscoin is a blockchain project that is solving most problems Ethereum and Bitcoin are facing. SYS has great potentials, #ceres have lots of room to grow I know most of you won‚Äôt believe me but: ultrasafe/ultra protocol. Seriously! I‚Äôve been just listening to the latest ama and these devs are not f‚Äôking around. The stuff they have planed for the next monthsüò± I‚Äôve been chilling this project for some time now with price quite stable but just do 1 thing: checkout the ama and website and decide for yourself. 
You‚Äôll thank yourself (and me obviously) later. (Btw if you so: I welcome yr moonsüôÉ) Serious answer. Check out the GojiCrypto project. I will say no more All in for TXL. It's really pulling grounds after the Cross-Chain Bridge v2.0 launch. Decentralization, self-listings, yield for liquidity which projects provide to bridges, NFT & Stablecoin support. 1000blocks approx 1 mil mkcap, innovative yielding / distribution of tokens in a fair way. Rewarding users with BNB tokens instead of only their tokens and you have a chance to be creative. Also they are getting smart NFTs this year. 
They are shipping regularly and potential is probably HUGE. Nothing like discovering a gem in crypto. In fact, your ability to find gems is what your crypto journey is based on. 

The likes of SNX and DAFI protocol fall into that category. DAFI essentially creates limitless applications that support reduced inflation & user growth. 

Currently, over 21 networks have switched to DAFI network with other $100B rewards market size. Let‚Äôs see how things pan out in the near future. Kardiachain - mainnet launched, decentralized exchange going, super fast and cheap transactions, great partnerships in SEA $DINGER - The the pioneer of #catszn is creating the 1st launchpad for new memecoin projects, providing a safe rug free space for early investors.  
  
Available on #BSC, #Ethereum & soon #PulseChain. find out more at: https://schrodingertoken.com Def ERGO has so much room to grow I like that new Tron promotion on Moonstake, a great choice to partner up with them in the first place as i find the platform quite reliable so far, and I think it'll put Tron even further up on the map I'd say Saito - L1 with impressive tech and still a low-cap. Koinos. Experienced devs who worked on Steem blockchain. Not bullshit ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù nonsense. Do your own research but I support KOIN because they are serious, competent, and care more about success of the project than blowing up the currency. I havent really got so attached to a project like **Qanplatform,** This is not a shill but it rather based on my perspective on the project and how it can improve the crypto space and every users that uses the platform. Talking about the coin QANX- which has already gone 9x just over 3 months since launch and its still showing the potential of pumping. It has a low MC and it has crossed the 16,000 holder mark. Qanplatform is a quantum resistant layer 1 hybrid blockchain platform. Where users can build smartcontracts, Dapp, Defi, Nft, Cryptocurrency. The testnet is launching next month and i have high hope on that Near Protocol would be my top pick, announced $800M grant, sharding (phase 0), the ecosystem is booming and it is one of the most undervalued L1 project. XYO QanX, LRC, Polygon, DCIP, Cro. Keep and eye on Filecoin. It‚Äôs been silent but I believe it will pop end of this year / Q1 2022. Reason is due to their integration with Matrix AI Network. Matrix AI network has a TON of stuff coming out in December & March centered around NFT trading. CTX - Governance token for TCAP - a token that tracks the total market cap for crypto via chainlink feeds - imagine the S&P 500 of crypto. TCAP can be minted from a vault similar to a maker vault. It currently trades at a premium from minting on sushi swap. CTX is also available on Gemini.

NOTE - New fix lending/borrowing platform. Great rates for farming with stables and for LP on balancer. Coinbase ventures was part of the early seed round.

It's my opinion that both of these have room to do a 10x or more. I'm invested in both. CKB I have been following closely Unique Network for a while now...  
Long story short, it's a cross-chain/multi-chain NFT project with game changing NFT features, like Programmable NFTs, High Scalability and High Customizability. It's Environmentally conscient (was on COP26 recently), it has a Serious & Dedicated team which can be easily reached through it's Telegram group. Unique aims to Lower the Barriers of Entry for everyone both on the fee level and on the ease of use. It aims to be as user friendly as it can be.  
Recently Unique Network secured it‚Äôs parchain on Kusama network through Quartz, and it‚Äôs aiming for it‚Äôs own parachain on Polkadot network  
Quartz TGE (Token Generation Event) will take place on early December.

1,"The majority of top crypto projects in the market have reached their potential, so what to invest in?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/ta1pzk/the_majority_of_top_crypto_projects_in_the_market/,"Looking at how some projects in the market right now have pumped by 10,000% over the years, makes me wonder if they reached their fully potential, and if its worth it to invest in them or i missed the train. 

I personally would rather invest in projects in their beginning stages, doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôll break out tomorrow or in the coming years, as long as they have fundamentals and are trustworthy. 

I‚Äôm currently focusing on DeFi projects like BitDAO, since the crypto market has been dumping for god knows how long. 

I chose BitDAO as an example since it‚Äôs the key to investing in multiple DeFi projects, and is funding projects like zkDAO, eduDAO, and game7, that are making a difference in the market.",11,56,False," Ckb is an undervalued one. Bezoge Iotex Autobahn Network is a layer 2 built as an Optimistic Rollup with Solidity-based Smart Contracts for high-performance dApps. $TXL Lol That is one of the reasons why, after conducting extensive research into its tokenomics, strategic partners, backers, community, exchanges, and so on, I invest more in low caps because I believe they have more room for growth potential. I recently increased my holdings of DKT, MPL, TOWER, CVP, SYS, and other stocks in order to profit from the next bull run. Though I rarely chase pumps, I love buying at the bottom so I can harvest as the token grows. AXL is one I'd put all my money in, it's not yet well-known, but it has so many use cases, including allowing the swapping of crypto assets from one chain to another. You don't necessarily need to invest in big projects if you feel like they don't have much space to grow. I am sure that some mainstream ones like ETH, BTC, DOT... have a lot of room to grow but I also like investing in some new stuff or projects with lower MCap.

I've been bagging YLD and KALM lately because they are the main source of my passive income in addition to Celsius and Freeway (that I don't utilize much lately).

When it comes to the projects that are not yet listed, UNQ is my no.1 priority. They are conducting the crowdloan on March 14th and I already prepared my DOT tokens to participate. It's the last chance to get some before the official TGE and listing.

There are things to do, we just need to do a lot of research. As a matter of fact I keep seeing BitDAO a lot lately. Two perfect examples of unpumped (future giants) you should look into:

- Radix, XRD / eXRD:

Layer 1, new DLT type, new consensus, sharding, the only L1 that claims to have solved atomic composability across shards.

- BrightUnion, BRIGHT:

DeFi insurance gem, first mover product (the 1inch of DeFi insurance). Risk Index platform, earn 20-30% on stablecoins. Well I don't think so, there are lots of projects that still have a lot to offer in terms of their utility just like PNODE which serves as the driver of the pinknode ecosystem a project that offers node-as-a-service to devs looking to connect to the polkadot ecosystem. BitDAO is a good DeFi gem too just like SYLO. it‚Äôs another good DeFi gem with so much utility available on it decentralized platform, the web 3 Sylo wallet. and I think it‚Äôs the next big thing we should keep on close watch If top crypto projects have reached their potential why not consider the low caps with solid fundamentals, you'll find a bunch of them. I'm into a few undervalued project but I'm particular about the likes of OIN, DIA, SPOOL even OCEAN is still undervalued in my opinion.

Catch them at their lows so that you may laugh when they hit their highs. ;) You‚Äôve actually said what a lot of people are thinking and I agree with you, I‚Äôve always know that getting in on a new project early is more beneficial, I like to look at crowdloans and new listings for new projects with potential.

The next parachain auction is coming up and I‚Äôve been doing research on projects that would be participating, there have only been one confirmed project yet which is Unique network, it‚Äôs a NFT chain that has good history and also shares the marketplace profits with the NFT holders, the third revenue share was just distributed, it looks like they know exactly how to win the hearts of their community. Privacy protocols are yet to attain that potential and privacy protocols like RAIL, SCRT, KEPP, etc are on the fast track towards mass adoption and will be a good time to get involved with any of them. Unido, a crypto custodial solutions which will be launching its enterprise platform today is still undervalued at the moment. Its a good project to invest in. I'll suggest that you look into UDO from the enterprise-grade platform available for decentralized capital markets using a suite of DeFi and crypto banking tools for proper asset management - Unido. As it will be launching its first product - UnidoEP with several upgrades and features including in-app staking this quarter. I am looking forward to investing as an early bird in Gamestar+, which is the next generation of streaming platforms that combines classic games and blockchain gaming architecture. With top brands like Marvel and Disney being on deck it is going to be massive IMO. That is partially true, as most prominent crypto projects have either   
attained their full potential or have minimal room for expansion.

Personally, I'm excited to invest in play to earn games because they're still early in the year and have a lot of promise.

Such example is investing in GSTAR token, Gamestar+'s native token, which is expected to launch in March 2022. DVDX is well below its potential RN. 
They‚Äôre building the next gen chain agnostic synthetic trading platform. 
And a zero slippage dex The board game industry is breaking out and that's something to look out for. GSTAR is a token to bag once it gets launched as GameStar+ is bringing these popular board games to screen. Litbit finance is coming on Cronos blockchain LOOPRING",0.9992
1,"Memecoins can surely be good investments, don't let people convince you otherwise. Be cautious though!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/rxt8f9/memecoins_can_surely_be_good_investments_dont_let/," I've said it before and I'll say it again: meme coins aren't the finest projects out there, but they're the sort of project you'll love investing in. When you invest in a meme currency, you can expect to hear a lot of negative press and people warning you that you're making a mistake. 

 I appreciate that certain meme coin groups are pursuing unattainable targets, such as Shiba reaching $1, but there are others that see the long-term value of their investment. The fact that we, as investors, characterize the whole meme coin space by Shiba and Doge is also a difficulty for meme currencies. While it is one of the fastest-growing segments of the cryptocurrency market, certain coins, such as Strong Inu, have lately seen a huge growth (over 150% in 24h). 

 I'm not claiming that the top project will be a meme coin, but it's undoubtedly one of the areas that will attract a large number of investors in the next years, and they can provide some interesting investment opportunities.",7,57,False," Sure, Anything 'can' be a good investment but chances are it wont be....

&#x200B;

My issue with Memecoins is simple - you are buying Meme and selling Meme coins to people that buy and Sell Meme coins the 'creators' make big money whilst others hope to make a 'quick buck' of other people FOMO'ing in.

the majority of people 'dont make money' but a small % will make big gains.

&#x200B;

You are essentially gambling but you know most of the money is going to the useless devs trying to make a quick buck.

&#x200B;

Im not saying i've never brought a meme coin but meme coins are not 'good investments' just because someone wins the lotto on a $15 ticket doesnt mean everyone will. If you buy some rubbish like Shib or Doge dont expect to make money just do it for fun and if you do then thats great. Meme tokens are not an investment, they are a gamble. 

If you are lucky to get in at the right time you can make good money but the odds are against it. Investment is something that has a business strategy behind it and a utility of some sort. It is not an investment if you are hoping a celebrity will tweet about it.

I am not against meme coins, I own a ton of SHIB. But I bought them as a lottery ticket and nothing more. Y'all sleeping on banano Shibonk is looking strong. Less than 10mc and has potential to 10x or 100x at least. I enjoy the community as well as the memes. We have a niche for everyone that wants to be part of something fun and rewarding. We are looking to hook up with Shibarium in the future once it is released.

If you missed out on Shib Inu then i would suggest taking a look at Shibonk. 

Looking forward to seeing some new faces. There is a listing tool called MemeTools which helps to dicover these meme coins, I mean throwing 10 buck to a shitcoins might get you 5 figures 7 months later and the loss wouldn't be that much... Give me all the dogey coins It‚Äôs a bet, not an investment imo. It solely moves because of social media influencers and pumpNdumpers. Yes, you could make a ton of money, but you could also lose all of it‚Ä¶ easily. No amount of research could prepare you to ‚Äúinvest in a memecoin/shitcoin‚Äù SHIBO is a great project right now. Highly recommend checking it out. DYOR and you‚Äôll think so too. The problem with memes is they absorb funds that could be going to Bitcoin.  These coins will tarnish crypto. Most total useless. Premine 1 trillion.???? well based on I saw in every memecoins you need to hype it before it pumps. A memecoin can never be a good investment because it has by definition no fundamentals based on which you can invest.

Buying meme coins ist plain gambling. Why not go to the casino instead. You don‚Äôt understand what the word investment means.

Shoe shine boys giving stock advice and such memecoins are a crash indicator. The more people googling it the more likely a crash. (compare dogecoin and shiba inu on google trends with the btc price, its well known since 2017).

Memecoin holder are more likely to buy with leverage since they re delusional. 

I dont want to explain liquidation and stuff. i think you guys got it. I agree. Meme coins can be a good investment, but one has to always find a better coins with good potential. Personally, I'm just got myself some Dogelon Mars just before it made its x100 last month, and I'm expecting another pump soon. I think you can do yourself a favour and invest in Strong Inu. I can't see another meme coin that has this kind of project and ideology. Invest in nodes and you will have passive income, what more can you ask for? You don‚Äôt understand what investing means. Buy and selling something to make money from it is trading it. Not investing in it! I've always wanted to be my own boss, and the growth of the internet company has given me the opportunity to do so. Crypto and meme currencies have provided me with the possibility to invest and earn money online. Without the constraints of working hours, it's simple for me to keep track of coins and and to always be guided by which coin you can always earn more! For me, Strong INU, for example, was the discovery of the century! I heard so much positive about it that in the end I had to buy it and I can tell you that I did not regret a second!

1,Improving the Fundamentals of Prediction Markets ‚Äî Liquidity and User Experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/mkjqda/improving_the_fundamentals_of_prediction_markets/,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vt5hpo99ocr61.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=42f5a84efa4100517578810a3fa4210343544bc2

 

*‚ÄúHonestly prediction markets may be one of the most underrated categories of Ethereum dapps right now‚Äù* ‚Äî [Vitalk Buterin](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1309078385369460741?lang=en)

Prediction   markets have existed in the Ethereum ecosystem since 2015 with the   launch of Augur a peer-to-peer order book based prediction market.   Despite being one of the earliest dapps on Ethereum, prediction markets   have made little progress compared to others like DEXs, NFTs, and DeFi   tools like lending and borrowing and leverage. Let us explore the   existing options and the problems they face. Later we will see how   PredictX aims to redefine prediction markets as a legitimate use case   for DeFi by ensuring better liquidity and aligning incentives for the   ecosystem.

**The Liquidity Problem:**

The major limitation to prediction markets is a lack of liquidity and lack of volume. [Augur](https://augur.net/)   through its decentralized order book-based model has very little   liquidity in its markets and the little liquidity in its ecosystem is   spread thing because of an oversaturation of event markets. Other peer   to pool (AMM based) protocols like [Gnosis](https://omen.eth.link/#/liquidity) and [Catnip](https://catnip.exchange/markets/0x5f623023ab1e7ff12b8fc02e4ee8cdcad67d0e80) also have very low liquidity which in turn result in little trade volume because of slippage.

When   there is low liquidity, for users to take a position on the outcome of   an event, it will cost them more money than the likelihood of the  event  happening.

*So   let‚Äôs say an event market has 10 yes shares and 10 no shares. If   someone wanted to buy 1 yes share, then the price quoted for that yes   share would be around 0.5. However, if that someone wanted to buy 5 yes   shares, then the price quoted would be as high as 0.7 because there are   not many yes/no shares in the pool to begin with. This slippage would   not exist if were 1000 yes shares and 1000 no shares since that someone   buying 5 yes shares would get quoted a price around 0.5.*

So   liquidity is needed in order to make sure that the quoted price (i.e.   the price initially) is close enough to the execution price (the price   finally). This is a major problem in prediction markets and can only be   solved by having liquid markets.

**The User Experience Problem:**

On   top of the low liquidity and volume, these decentralized platforms  also  don‚Äôt facilitate a good user experience from the interface to the   process of executing a transaction along with high gas fees on  Ethereum.

How to solve this? The solution is [here](https://medium.com/predictx-official/improving-the-fundamentals-of-prediction-markets-liquidity-and-user-experience-992a56479efe).",4,1,False," This is basically a prediction app, right?",0.0
1,What are you buying now?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/tfrhz8/what_are_you_buying_now/,"Hi guys, today Bitcoin is back to $40,000 and in my personal opinion will continue to grow. I'm interested to know what tokens the crypto community is buying now, and what it prioritizes.  

Personally, I believe that it is best to buy L1 blockchains that have excellent fundamentals and have been cheaper in price over the past couple of months. For example now I buy: NEAR, DOT, SOL. I believe that these projects have a future and their ecosystems will only expand. 
And what are you buying?",6,44,False," Ckb, gala and loopring CKB, ONE, and Matic RFOX, without any hesitation, a low-cap gem poised to explode in the crypto market with lots of future potential and real-world use case. Matic, Pnt, and Leo will undoubtedly be included in whatever I'm buying. Buying now that prices are down is the best because we get to buy at discounts. I'm taking my time to buy some low capped gems before the market sentiments turn around.

DKT because it's one of the best gaming low caps around. Good use case, solid partners and a very solid and working team. RFOX  too because they are creating an immersive metaverse for all. With gaming/metaverse gaining so much traction, these ones would do well. At the moment only BTC AND ETH, the market is just too much. But I am also buying FRA which is Findora's Native token and I'm staking on a dex that is launched on their mainnet Oraichain, sold my other bags for that Yep, also think buying now is a good decision. When the upward movement starts it may be too late and we miss sweet prices I got Dot and Avax last week, would like to add another one but idk I'm pretty new to crypto still. Everytime there's an upswing like today it just trickles back down for 3 days. Matic, Atom, Ftm, Gala and topping it up with Axl, a DEX that looks promising with it's interoperability features which allows the swapping of crypto assets from one chain to another DUST to enter Galaxis.xyz projects 
SOS token (and staking at ~90%)
Ether card founder cards (to earn dust)
DG wearables (to create your own poker guild) XMR , BCN , LUNA Great post. Im buying SOL, DOT, HEX, and Archangel Token. ARCHA is a new project but I love their utilities and ecosystem. I also bought some more ETH!>  Jump onboard now before is too late. Now always do your own research, I personally look for projects that have utilities and are older than 4 months. If I invest on a new project I must do a lot of research to make sure my investment is safe! Good luck to all crypto investors and remember the next 2-4 years are going to be massive on Crypto. GRT Cryptocurrency will always reward you. The situation is changing at a breakneck pace. Just like KOLnet, the first marketing DEX that would monetize Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) for their services across platforms, which is currently getting ready to launch! Its ticker symbol is KOL, and it will be a major utility player in the future. The opposite of whatever this sub says to buy Ecosystem tokens could do really well in the coming months, EGLD NEAR XTZ ALGO are my favorites and I'm holding a decent bag of all four. 

I also have some low caps on my radar; FUFU MNW HUSL are good ones and they're worth checking out. I'm buying more low caps right now, and I recently added some DKT to my portfolio because I think it's a solid project with a good use case that has recently migrated to the BSC network; there are also speculations that it will be listed on a CEX soon. NEAR, DOT and SOL are solid alts, not FA but lowcaps are best to buy in a dip especially utility token with disruptive usecases like TXA which drives the ecosystem of projects TXA a decentralized settlement layer solution for exchanges with a combination of cex and dex features to form a hybridDex which will benefit day traders and volume trading with faster transactions and settlement. ETH, MATIC and ORE. For L1 blockchain platform then I'll go with ETH, DOT, EGLD and UTK. Not a mistake that I added UTK cause it's from a web 3.0 L1 payment technology offering crypto payment solution to thousands of merchants across the globe including the well-known Alternative Airlines, Woocommerce and Shopify. VITE, VITC, ONE, SAITO I bought SLP, I am  reserving the remaining money for  kolnet IDO, they will be launching soon. kolnet as a project bridges projects to KOLs ( key opinion leaders ) and micro influencers, which in turn help the projects gain the required awareness they deserve. I'm considering adding to my Matic and Lox bags. NEAR is a good pick now, IMO. I‚Äôve been watching it closely during last year. It was doing very good. It looked like it was about to moon just when whole market was collapsing. So I expect it to do that once the market fairly recovers.",0.9991

Once you decided on a baker you can make close to 6% APY in rewards *immediately*. You have to wait 37 days before your first rewards are paid out and then every 3 days after that. And you can pull your delegation at any time and re-delegate to a new baker. Nothing. Just wait. Lol BTC, ETH, SOL, DOT and AVAX are all solid projects at a great discount. LRC, IMX? FTM I‚Äôm buying CoinMerge. The LLC‚Äôs platform www.coinmerge.io is innovative and have they a business plan set up to reward their investors.

Essentially own stake in a reliable company.

Check them out! RBIF RBIF is showing great promise and is still early Nothing but RBIF! RBIF getting shilled hard. Obvious this thread was posted in one of their channels. I bought in RBIF late december, where I was around the 750th holder. I am following its progress ever since and must say I am impressed by the Dev team. I made it my unicorn for 2022, do your own research and feel free to join the ride! Buy projects you think sound good.  I like cardano because of it‚Äôs Africa work, mana because of decentraland, ENJ because games, etc.. I‚Äôve been investing in crypto for many years and have seen many market cycles. I would always recommend including a small market cap token that has very high growth potential as part of any diversified portfolio. In today‚Äôs market, for me, top picks for large/mid/small cap portfolio is BTC/DOT/RBIF in whichever ratio best satisfies
your risk appetite. DYOR but in my opinion, these are the projects you should be in if you can only pick one from each category. And if you  haven‚Äôt looked into RBIF you should do so immediately üòâ RBIF is going to be the next shib!! A very young project that got listed on bitmart 2 weeks ago. It will be doing a 1% burn of the total supply once we get 3000 holders on etherscan! Robo inu has been my top gainer in these crazy markets since December. Wish I had better advice #NotFinancialAdvice Robo Inu is the one for 2022. #RBIF [removed] Want to invest in something that will TRULY change your life then buy #RoboInu... SHIBA SHIBA SHIBA Shibadoge, it's the memcoin with the the most .0s in the price and the most solid dev and marketing team.  Not all memecoins are managed the same.  They also have an NFT collection that can be staked for Shibadoge, they built this whole crypto/NFT ecosystem there is no other token/NFT relationship like this. I recently bought Dot and Avax, I think these two are pretty stable with a lot of potential from what I've seen. I'm pretty new to crypto trading so I don't fully know what I'm doing yet. ICP Tectonic is my new favorite project. m very bullish on upbots and the token has been rising steadily now,mega updates are round the corner and from past experiences i can tell the price would spike! There is no way im selling .Not for 2 months atleast. ETH can never go wrong with. And Theta Banano. XMR. BTC. In that order Mmf,mmo,cyborgswap, cronoswap, cro,vvs finance, tonic üëå. All solid projects. absolutely buy nothing until btc hits about 30k big caps: cardano (ada), harmony (one), vechain (vet)‚Ä¶. small caps: coti, verasity, alchemy pay Looking at your existing portfolio spread, I see innovation and projects with lots of potential. The core concept of NEAR is finding solutions and leading innovations. If your looking for a low cap alt coin, with the same chore beliefs then you should check out the Archangel Ecosystem. The ArchAngel Token is the golden key to staking rewards from the entire ecosystem. Each project within the ecosystem provides a solution based utility to problems identified from the crypto community (identified using actual research). 

Not to mention that ARCHA is a trademarked DoV and a registered US company. Roots are planted and I don't think it is going anywhere. Especially with the upcoming releases within the ecosystem... Guardian Token will be launching soon along with the Guardian platform. Which will be a consolidated spot for news, education, and all kinds of tools for investment tracking and growth such as risk assessment, project communication, and even a component for trust fund like utility. 

There are several token/projects releasing as components of Guardian, contributing to the ARCHA Staking rewards. Aurora token PATIENCE, only shitcoin I m trading. I'm not making any moves until there's some kind of sign that world issues are going to improve. Atom, avax, Luna and ftm are my safe havens 

or maybe some gaming ones like, SAND or Gala have some pretty good future projects even avax is joining the gaming scene soon Definetely STILTON 
It's Elons favorite cheese... this project will be huge espacially in the upcoming meme coin season
Loaded up my bags this weekend again because next week the big big Marketing Kicks in. Still under 10M MC but next week will be Space launch with live TV, influencers and YouTubers to reveal and Post about the project. Still so much More to come ... and you are in early.. I mean under 10M MC

Twitter: https://twitter.com/StiltonMusk?t=3XCl2wymjdLbs04C43UuLg&s=09 Near and Dot is a good now. I will recommend UBXT, is a native token to upbots, you can stake it  to earn passive income, you can also trade with their trading bot to make some profit from the dip. They have long and short trades . Yey mate, take a look at OCEAN. 

It is fully undervalued at this point and with strong potential in the future. 

Ocean Protocol is the leading project on new data economy, DataFi, and WEB3 development. At Ocean marketplace, people worldwide can tokenize its data and monetize it in a safe way. That's some great recommendations you got there. Because I'm consolidating more on web3 centered projects, I'm also looking at DOT, LINK, & DIA.

I'm also staking some DIA genesis NFTs for the long-term. Hoping to accumulate enough bebore price goes back to ATH and possibly beyond. I recommend that you invest in good top cap projects like NEAR, BNB, MATIC, LUNA, ETH, and others now that everything is down and you can get them at a discount. You can also invest in low-cap projects such as JUNO, TRIAS, OIN, TEAM, NGM, and others with money you can afford to lose. Take a look at trac for long term (if you find a coin with the same stats tell me, I‚Äôll invest). CTSI is on a good dip nowadays! I wish I could just buy in now and start riding it, rather than force-buying to lower my previous entry point. LOL But I think we‚Äôll see nice gains - it‚Äôs a Layer2 with Linux infrastructure. It will do good in my opinion once the dapps start populating the ecosystem‚Ä¶ The dip to keep dipping alive RBIF is a solid choice imo low caps for me GTH DAFI

large caps for me FTM ATOM SKL Well, I already own those you mentioned above. I think right now if one wants to play it safer, it is smart to stick to the blue chips. I hold a few low caps like SPOOL, DIA, OCEAN. It is definitely a bad time to trade them because it will be for lower value, so I'll ride with them as time in the market beats timing the market. I'm eyeing more AVAX and MATIC. Juno 

Thank me in 1 year HBAR I've been bagging a lot of rail lately, still low cap and I feel the price would spike as the need for privacy tokens keep increasing. I am in love with the ATOM and DOT ecosystems! Consider some ATOM and if you are into small caps, consider using you DOT to take part on Unique Network crowdloan for a Polkadot Parachain starting tomorrow. Buy SURV I'd recommend you to ape in Package Portal (PORT), Axion, OIN and CLNY. Also, getting ready to ape in wTEAM/ TEAM. 

From tomorrow users can become an LP now to gain an early start in the farms!  
Amount: Approximately 130,000 TRI/month + 5,000 wNEAR/month  
Separately, they also have Stability Pool rewards on the OINDAO itself for users who wish to stake aUSDO on our platform to boost participation in the first month:  
10,000 OIN tokens in total!

TEAM DAO can be a shortcut for people to get into P2E gaming. TEAM‚Äôs vision is to develop the metaverse and P2E economy. They accomplish this by improving the livelihoods and quality of life for all players in the TEAM ecosystem. BAT is kicking some ass despite the stagnation of BTC. $ban Anything you're buying now, never go all in. But buy in bits through DCA.

NEAR is a good one. You can check AURORA; its layer 2 scaling solution or OIN; stablecoin issuance platform

Both are ecosystem projects, with an active community. safe bet is btc and eth and maybe luna that‚Äôs about it Shibs on sale until may...when it pumps a bit before going sideways until October for the big end of year pump. Right now ATOM, OCEAN, JUNO and NGM are the coins I'd recommend to any new buyers. I recently added MATIC and also recommend the web3 oracle token DIA which recently got listed on Coinbase, Huobi, and Cryptocom. The team made a partnership with CF Benchmarks, which was reflected in the price. You should be considering XPRESS and ENJIN. 

For XPRESS, you can see the attention their app CryptoXpress is gaining.

Their NFT marketplace is cheap, and they offer crosschain NFTs powered by Polygon Personally I'm buying AGLD HUSL ATOM DOT SOL and BBANK

From the list, I would reccomend BBANK and AGLD, these two have an insane potential to blow up There is a lot of buyzones now in the crypto market and that includes $ETH and $BNB. But, DeFi seems to be a logical investment opportunity right now due to their attractive APY.

DAFI and YLD have ticked several of these boxes. Platform like DAFI offers attractive APY and low gas fee due to BSC network integration. YLD has an impressive liquidity pool also. Maybe you can deduce a pick from my choice. I've gat SOL, ETH, MATIC and DOT; ETH being the biggest bag, now on staFi. FIS and GNS lowMcap pick. Apparently, I'm not buying anything more other than adding to my SOL bag and keeping my staking plan going seamlessly. Good choice with ETH and DOT you can also add some low cap gems on the Polkadot ecosystem like UDO to your portfolio. MATIC, NGM, JUNO, ATOM, DYDX, OCEAN, DOT, OSMO

Good tokens worth buying some especially for passive earnings I think Catcoin is the only project I‚Äôm excited about. It‚Äôs could easily go parabolic once they get listed on a tier 1 exchange. NEAR SOL DOT and ALBT are all good buys right now. 
The market isn‚Äôt looking so good right low but when it returns, these coins will moon I suggest that you buy some MATIC, AVAX, and the dips in some low caps such as DKT, NII, SYS, and CVP to ensure that you are well-positioned in the market upturn. You can consider adding XPRESS and any other new generational gem. CryptoXpress is one of the most useful cryptocurrency tools available in the market and with their cross-chain NFTs, It could only get better. You already got nice bags though you could consider adding this low cap gems with good fundamentals ; ENJ, PINK and EGLD Ethereum of course. Saitama... I'm big on Solana. Checkout Solana pay.

I'm an engineer and Solana has a lot of really smart people working on it.

I don't know if it'll ever beat eth in market cap. But I think it's a safe 2-10x bet over the next 5 years. If I buy its going to be RBIF or LRC. Good luck on what ever you decide XRP through Uphold.

1,I have $100 to buy my first crypto. Which one would you buy and why ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/qt7257/i_have_100_to_buy_my_first_crypto_which_one_would/,In 2015 I was about to buy 1 BTC and I didn't. I will not do the same mistake again. What is the trendiest coin on the market nowadays ? Thank you all.,21,116,False," Avalanche or Solana Not investment advice, but if I could hold only 1 it would still be BTC. It‚Äôs becoming the most mainstream and has a lot of institutional banking at this point. Second would be ETH. A common portfolio is something like 50% BTC, 25% ETH, and 25% a mix of whatever else you want to buy. Hbar because it's undervalued. When people start leaving ETH due to gas, it'll boom Buy $XPR. ZERO gas fees for sending any token. DYOR I would wait till the market cools down and buy Avax, helium,  both projects that will be there in 5-6 years 
If you really want to invest now 
Quant is cheap atm If it's just to hodl. I would create a Binance account and buy BNB and stake it in BNB Vault. You will get passiv more coins Look into SYLO, I like it because it has a working product and still very cheap. Potentially, it can x5 even before the end of this year when you see some of the updates they've lined up for release. $LUNA.....$KDA..... You're welcome! Crypto dot com. This is MySpace era. Bitcoin So not financial advice just my opinion, I want you to hear what I say, consider it, and then make your own decision.

$100 isnt much, most people think that 100 on the right low price coin could make them 500x investment if they pick the right coin, while that technically not untrue, good luck being the person to pick the next parabolic coin.

While that isnt much, I dont mean that it's not smart to invest it or start out with 100, because it is, in fact I think that's a better way to start than with 500k to throw on random shit, you'll learn more and be able to DCA your portfolio and build it instead of the instinctual attempt to scalp a fortune in a week.

You should start by looking at what some top coins are, do a shit ton of research into the fundamentals of what makes this one stand out from the rest, do some technical Analysis and find out what is better set to breakout in the future, and what is built to stay - example, bitcoin is a coin that has excellent fundamentals and is set to be used and with more and more implementation into the real world you will see this possibly be the next dollar; imagine getting invested in the US dollar when before it was mainstream, buying $100 dollars worth every week, and receiving 500 pieces of paper per $100 for a year - you would have payed $5200 over time for a currency you believed in and it would have been worth $26000.

Make sure your that you have a good reason to buy into whatever coin you choose and even if that coin loses 20% over time, and nothing has changed as far as why you initially invested, leave it and buy more every week/month/etc. There is no infinite money trick and finding a 10x coin before it goes 10x is theoretically impossible to do, once the money is invested, you need to act as if it's no longer there, ofc check on it every so often and keep up with news, but as far as you know you no longer have that money, until something changes in your view of the fundamentals or a big breakout where you might want to take SOME profits in order to reinvest or whatever.

>I wont give you my advice on what to invest in, but to get you started on research - Google fundamentals of ETH look into ETC unpopular opinion but I'm a big fan of ETC, but that's not why you should look into it) look into how it was formed, learn about hard-fork coins, learn  about what crypto is fully before you invest as it makes things a lot easier. I will just list a few that you should research, start with google, and if you need questions answered that you cant find ask it here and I will most likely be a commenter there as well, this is not by any order, not by favoritism as I'm only invested in one coin atm and will not list it.

* BTC
* ETH

Invest in coins that have fundamentals, not speculations. I personally like Nano but there are  other coins with good fundamentals. The best is not to ask other people, but to make your own research. 
Anyway loopring (LRC). There are plenty of DD‚Äôs on r/Superstonk or r/Loopringorg that explain what lrc is and it‚Äôs potential ( loopring subreddit was at 15k members not even two weeks ago) [removed] Considering the amount I will   opt in on solid project with low mcap that have good potential. I would choose FWT. Over 40% of it circulating supply are natively staked on the platform. It is my potential moon shot gem [removed] Gaming projects are taking over the space and WFAIR is indeed a good crypto to buy. The greatest driver of a crypto is the level of adoption. WFAIR now out as the native token for the DeFi casino project and will surely do great. I would try to buy ETH, send it to my wallet, then swap it to something else on Uniswap and see if it all disappeared... I believe in shitcoins at moment i am with CatBonk You may invest in a gaming project that is growing and improving. I invested in WFAIR, which has a fantastic platform for p2e games and is currently transitioning to the metaverse. [removed] You can check out DEIP. 
It‚Äôs currently on presale so it‚Äôs the best time to buy in. 
It‚Äôs got an amazing technology innovation and will surely thrive in the nearest future If  had additional $100 I will add that to my PKR portfolio which has given me great gains of 6x profit . May also add it up to get into the upcoming IDO of the ARC token. Spare some of that $100 to get into Subsquid's token launch coming up in Q1 2022. It has huge potential. Subsquid is developed customisable high-performance APIs to help developers build amazing applications for web3.  Evergrow coin EGC is a great opportunity for the average person and the already wealthy to make a fortune. Has a lot of cool and rewarding things happening. Don‚Äôt miss out on the opportunity and do your research. It‚Äôs fixing to double over the next few weeks in my opinion. Good luck! I had the same question a few months ago, i did my own research ( and you should do that also ) and had chosen XRP Buy $FWT and $XRP, $FWT because it has an absolutely solid use case DeFi banking with 100 percent guarantee. $XRP because it also has a solid use case it's about to run $ETH  off the market.

Very important: buy $BMI, it's going to be massive. Solid use case too: DeFi insurance. Need I say more? $DOT is a secure long-term investment, which will be mainstream. I also added $DIA to my portfolio which is an oracle platform that has integrated its oracle service to many partners, so I think it will be mainstream too, as its services spread all over the crypto space. I would do 50 in BTC, 30 in ETH, and 20 in ADA. Easily $TKING rn, season 2 Tiger King drops on Nov 17th. Gotta be the best advertisement for a coin of all time. Probably a 10-100x gain given current market cap. Check out the fundamentals yourself, it's not just a pump and dump meme coin like so many put it out to be.

 If you don't bother to check it out and just dismiss this, well I tried to help you, sorry ü§∑ Not gonna be a charity with my gains for the holidays to anyone but my fam DERO, private blockchain with smart contracts it will attract all the current DeFi once regulators start doing their criminal laws.

1,What is a dApp?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/uxjm29/what_is_a_dapp/,"The latest breakthrough technological advances have made it possible for developers to create new kinds of products. One that is especially promising is the introduction of decentralized applications ([dApp](https://getblock.io/blog/how-to-build-a-dapp-blockchain-developer-is-starter-pack-by-getblock/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)), which are heavily reliant on blockchains and crypto.

At its core, each dApp combines a smart contract (a backend) and a frontend user interface. dApps are built by utilizing fully transparent codes governed by autonomy, and a specific consensus algorithm to back up their value (e.g. [Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Work](https://getblock.io/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-whats-the-difference/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)).

Most applications we use in our day-to-day life are centralized. This means that everything contained and posted on the app, including its database, is owned and controlled by a single - centralized - entity. Some of the centralized apps examples are Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. dApps are fundamentally different in their structure.

N.B. Check out Getblock‚Äôs [guide](https://getblock.io/blog/how-to-build-a-dapp-blockchain-developer-is-starter-pack-by-getblock/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) on how to build a dApp

As mentioned above, dApps are centered around blockchains with smart contract support. A smart contract is essentially a self-executing program stored on a blockchain, which contains an agreement between the seller and the buyer in the form of a specific code. Blockchains, which offer smart contract support, provide efficient and censorship-resistant solutions for dApp developers.

The list of such blockchains includes [*Ethereum (ETH)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/eth/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)*,* [*Binance Smart Chain (BSC)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/bsc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)*,* [*Polygon (previously Matic Network, MATIC)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/matic/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)*,* [*Tron (TRX)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/trx/)*,* [*Near (NEAR)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/near/)*,* [*Solana (SOL)*](https://getblock.io/en/nodes/sol/)*,* etc.

DeFi is a meaningful solution for making your crypto assets work for you. Dozens of Ethereum DeFi primitives are designed to do exactly that. So the question becomes: which platform should you choose?

You would want a platform capable of all the same things as Ethereum DeFi primitives. But if that platform should also add true cross-chain functionality and eliminate risk at the same time, it becomes unignorable.

These killer features are par for the course for Equilibrium. Equilibrium is the first interoperable cross-chain money market on Polkadot to combine pooled lending with the ability to generate and trade synthetic assets.

They‚Äôre going to break what this means and how it all works in an explanatory series of articles. We‚Äôll cover the advantages of our platform, how our EQ token works, and why our bailout mechanism is better than the usual auction for liquidating debt. 

First up is this big picture explanation of how our platform works, and why it‚Äôs an improvement over other solutions.

# Bringing DeFi‚Äôs bright, interoperable future to life

Those paying attention to crypto already know that DeFi, or decentralized finance, is the space‚Äôs big-deal breakout niche. DeFi is about using crypto methodologies and blockchain technology to reduce the number of intermediaries in a financial transaction and shifting control of user funds back toward the user again.

It‚Äôs an exciting premise, and we believe it‚Äôs the future of finance.

That‚Äôs why it should come as no surprise that the DeFi market has so far captured over $14 billion of disparate cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, EOS, and more. (ETH accounts for some 80% of the DeFi market despite representing just 12% of the overall crypto market.) These siloed assets are tied to dedicated blockchains that mostly lack the ability to communicate with or transact with each other.

This is no problem if you hold the particular asset that a DeFi project calls for, but it recasts that impressive $14 billion lump sum as several smaller piles of incompatible crypto that don‚Äôt know how to work together.

It begs the immediate question: what if they did work together? That‚Äôs why the word ‚Äúinteroperability‚Äù comes up rather often in DeFi conversations. Interoperability refers to adaptive crypto infrastructure that makes it possible to send a token from one blockchain to a wallet address on a completely different blockchain. An interoperable fintech platform can transact across otherwise incompatible blockchains.

Interoperability unifies the fragmented DeFi market into a cohesive $14 billion economic force. It lets people transact in the currencies that they want without concern for what currencies the other party receives. They can furthermore lock collateral on one blockchain network in order to get a loan on another.

These are the problems that Equilibrium solves. Powered by Polkdadot, Equilibrium uses a Substrate-based engine and cross-chain bridges to drive interoperability for DeFi liquidity pools. It unites these pools into a decentralized lending platform complete with advanced price discovery and bailout mechanics. Whatever transaction you need to conduct across whichever blockchains, Equilibrium‚Äôs technology can make it happen.

# EQ: Equilibrium‚Äôs core asset

The figurative star of the Equilibrium show is the EQ token, which works as bailout liquidity and collateral for loans. As collateral, EQ allows for raising liquidity in assets of the user‚Äôs choice, including Equilibrium‚Äôs native USD-pegged stablecoin. As bailout liquidity, holders can earn a decent return on it.

EQ tokens can also be used as a platform currency for paying fees, or as the means to gain access to Equilibrium‚Äôs decentralized governance system. This token is also a native asset for Equilibrium‚Äôs Parachain, which implies other use cases like voting for block producers and paying transaction fees.

These functionalities (not to mention the opportunities for liquidity farming) make EQ rather comparable to Synthetix‚Äôs SNX, one of the most popular DeFi tokens out there. EQ is cross-chain compatible and will first be ported to Ethereum ‚Äî we may potentially launch a Uniswap pool there.

I believe with the exponent of technology, BTC will be a dinosaur by 2022‚Äôs end. A ‚Äústablecoin‚Äù with quantum protection built in, will take take the world by storm. Something along the lines of ethereum will come in for the kill. But like I said, I‚Äôm a long time Hodler of Bitcoin and as far as current timeframe socioeconomics go, it‚Äôs fantastic. But the exponent of Technology is going to leave it behind sooner than later, in my opinion.",0.9209

But it‚Äôs not only about how much time do you spend time on researching, it‚Äôs more like what criteria are you looking for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/s0pnh3/if_one_wants_to_make_money_out_of_the/,"If you know well in the market, you know that it is now passing through a recession period. Totally normal. You should also be knowing that after a recession, recovery dominates and eventually a transition to an expansion takes place. Or if I may say 90% of the time that‚Äôs the case, right?

So it‚Äôs basically about where to dig and search, and which projects to invest in, (putting aside being hesitant and scared from tumbling). 

I for example, am only looking for the coins that are supported by some strong projects. Projects with real fundamentals that will maintain for a long time. Of course one of the top assets I‚Äôm keeping in my mind is Ethereum, as it‚Äôs surely supposed to be moving up in terms of price. But also MATIC has got a huge potential and is still one of the most undervalued assets in this market. I honestly believe that these two will be leading 2022 especially that they had a stellar year in 2021. And specifically speaking for this quarter, I feel MATIC will have a good run especially that the trading volume has improved after the bearish period.

It‚Äôs surely not an advise, literally I mean it. Do your own research guys. Each project you plan to invest in, try to evaluate the team behind it first, evaluate its technology and try to grade its assets.",3,16,False," Personally, I only invest in projects that pay a yield and that yield must come from outside money, not from inflation. There must be some kind of service provided by the token that people actually pay for, and part of those payments are given to the token holders.  

Otherwise it‚Äôs just speculation, or a Ponzi by another name. If it ‚Äúmight‚Äù make money one day, that‚Äôs at least better than 99% of the shit out there. But if it‚Äôs making money today and paying an APR that justifies it‚Äôs valuation, that‚Äôs a great project to be in. 
$GNS and gTrade is my top pick right now for these exact reasons. Also happens to be on Polygon. But what about those who invest blindfolded?  
 Invest everything in one coin and hold, be a man! Well said chief. 
If you actually take out time to research then you‚Äôll get you are looking for and win eventually. 
Last time I was checking Forbes, I found an article about DEIP bringing intangibles onchain in the form of fractionalized NFTs 
I participated in their last presale. MATIC undoubtedly is a giant on its own. A lot of projects saw it as an easy way of escape from the ridiculous fees on Ethereum. 

There are also some other project doing almost same thing in a totally different way. I came across Nahmii, another L2 solution also on Ethereum that introduces State Pools, a patent pending technology that provides everyone with the right tools to build solutions easily on Ethereum at scale. Another popular one is LOOP and it is becoming almost like a trend >I for example, am only looking for the coins that are supported by some strong projects. Projects with real fundamentals that will maintain for a long time.


Partners and good fundamentals goes a long way in determining how successful a project can be. With this criterion, SWASH comes to mind. It's a solid low cap gem but has great fundamentals and has decent partnerships with the likes of Chainlink, kucoin, Ocean, Streamer.",0.9962

People just can‚Äôt stop buying this token. This could very well be the next SHIBA!! 1000 X potential !!! See for yourself. BANK is the way to Financial Freedom!! 

With the Market Bleeding the way it is, very few coins are protecting their investors in viable rewards. Bankers Dream does exactly that. Through our Whale Fund, BUSD Rewards and Multiple New Investment Projects in the pipeline, we are not entirely reliant on our token to perform in order to make Passive Income. 

This model was chosen because it represents the very core of what this project is about. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called Bankers Dream. It‚Äôs a fund run by Trained Bankers adapting it to a strong use case in crypto currency. 
Providing strong liquidity and trust is one of the fundamentals of this project. 

The community also actively engages and votes on upcoming projects to invest in. We don‚Äôt consider ourselves as having any competition in this space, as this is a unique approach to our investment philosophy. 

Our Investors are HODLING strong and increasing their bags for bigger rewards. The tokenomics on this project is mind-blowingly simple but effective!!

For passive income I'm looking into projects that let you earn fees to hold like SPOOL and projects with staking like UFARM. We're so early rn I'm peeing my pants as I'm writing this! BankersDream is by far the best project I have invested in so far out of the 82 coins I hold! The community itself is amazing unlike so many other coins that I'm invested in where the community is so toxic. The devs are always around to answer questions and any concerns!!! I'm not trying to go crazy in shilling here but in my opinion based on my 82 investments over the past year or so I can confidently say that the bankersdream most resembles the early days of Safemoon and Shiba and I'm certain that it will be in the top 100 coins on CMC! 2022 is going to be the craziest year of my crypto escapades solely because of this amazing project and community!!! üöÄüåö I know it‚Äôs dumb to put most of your money in one spot and not diversify, but I love making money without having to chase ATH‚Äôs.

Thankfully I was able to join Mine Network that helped me with my liquidity issues. That is why Coinlist is so popular, they do deep research and find good projects.

If I do research myself I look at tokenomics, team, usecase etc.

But it seems most just look whether the project has a cool meme. It's a young market, it will 100% go through a bubble like the dotcom crash but I doubt we're in one right now, when you see sudden mass adoption with companies changing their name en masse to crypto stuff, then you can pull out.

It can be scary but dont let yourself crash with the wave in such a situation,crypto itself going tits up is okay but companies running to get boosted by proxy is not. Check out SpyWolf.Network.

I stopped buying smol coins
Cuz now we are ij the danger zone

1,"Supply, Price and Liquidity are what determines whether a token is good or filth",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/sjt445/supply_price_and_liquidity_are_what_determines/,"""

Basically, you can narrow it down to these three factors, when you are assessing a potential token you wish to use or are planning on researching. 

Supply is how much tokens exist in the market. The total current supply is how much there is now and this supply goes in relation with the creators‚Äô vision of what they want to use their token for.

It‚Äôs pretty basic to understand, and easy to explain the correlation price has with an token. Price is Market Cap over Supply. Its price is what you can physically feel, what can affect you the most, but it goes deeper than that. Price is only a result of multiple other factors that affect it. 

A lot of people you ask might overcomplicate this, but understanding a token is pretty basic at the surface level, and it‚Äôs pretty much what you want to look for before you take the plunge. What the price (what most people can see) of the token comes down to what the creator wants, if the creator wants a token that should be used to buy and sell good, for example a highly usable token, they could increase the supply in hand-in-hand with the market capital total. This keeps the price low and closer to real paper money. Similar to the work Cardano is putting in. If they want the token to be used as a base of wealth, they could decrease the supply with the increase of capital. Like the work the Ethereum is putting in. It‚Äôs not magic. 

New tokens are starting to understand this basic formula much better and expressing it more coherently, and I like the direction this is leading the market too. You can see this in the WOLF token project. There is no limit to the number of Wolf tokens that can be minted through a contract on the platform, Wolf tokens' buy and sell price increases and decreases with the number of tokens minted and burned, respectively, Tokens can be bought or sold instantaneously at any time, and the bonding curve acts as an automated market maker.""",0,8,False," There's also fundamentals, unless you are saying don't even start digging into fundamentals unless it ticks these boxes?",0.0

First, these projects leverage blockchain technology and best utilize their resources to innovate and have the greatest impact on people‚Äôs lives. 

For example MATIC, one of my favorite so far has the combination of low fees, ease of development and energy efficiency of Polygon PoS that sparked an adoption boom last year that it attracted some of the biggest projects in Web3, from DeFi to luxury brands and NFT marketplaces, right? Yet it continues to invent and advance the most innovative, current, scalable and life-changing products.

Second, simply if the project is innovating, providing to its community, always improving technology, then its token‚Äôs market value is surely subject to price improvements right? This kind of projects doesn‚Äôt only give its community, but it‚Äôll be giving the entire world of technology the needed additions, so their value will eventually go up with the rise of the technology itself. 

If you look for fundamentally strong projects that will bring better technology to the world, and will help to get the crypto scene and blockchain technology to better places, then you will surely be on the safe side in the future, no matter how the market is going to react today or tomorrow.",1,7,False,"

Projects like Polker, Honeyland and Axie will play a big role in reviving this industry through radical innovations. Terra's fall is simply as another excuse to start a bear market. I held a short bitcoin position on wowswap with 5x leverage from the 40k level and made a few thousand on it, but I'm still positive about the crypto market.

If you think a little deeper then this - you can still ""freeze"" it because the folks can't spend their funds anyways.

There is need to be more talk why a $5K price target justified for ETH. We need more talk about these blockchain‚Äôs utility. Right now, ETH is much more useable as a financial tool because its gas fees is significantly cheaper than before - all thanks to ETH price taking a dump. 

The purpose of ETH is to facilitate trust less and permission less financial transactions. It is not about pumping the price so overleveraged longs can go to the moon and achieve financial independence. That toxic moon mentality is why people see crypto as just the greater fool game.

Everyone talks about crypto as commodity and ETH like oil. But do you see commodity traders talking about oil mooning to $1000 as sustainable?

Yes, under such conditions after the willful destruction of supply chains, infrastructure, and capital, crypto would be of extremely limited use. Cardano to $10 BTC can and will absolutely hit 100k and higher. But it's going to 5k first. Honestly bottom is probably 15k like 20k is hurt enough but not enough in crypto only the worthy will have the golden ticket to 10k And it could just as easily got to 2k, why are these pump and dumps being promoted Both bitcoin and eth are absolute garbage.

Wenn der Hahn kr√§ht auf dem Mist, √§ndert sich das Wetter oder bleibt wie es ist.

Roughly translates to "" when the rooster crows on the dirtpile, the Weather will cange or it will stay as it is.""

Of course it can rise, it might as well crash without recovery. Who knows. Yeah....nah...... One of the issues I have with this logic is that with older projects like ETH and BTC, you end up with a lot of bag holders looking to dump at any hint of a rebound in prices. Investing in new projects like CNDL means that there are no bag holders to dump on you, particularly if there was no VC funding round. BTC will gapfill at 7400 then go into the hundreds of thousands by 2030. 

Just know btc going 60k>8k>150k is the equivalent of any other stock going from $60>$8>$150 (which is gamestop single month price action tbh) and doesn't actually represent spectacular gains. BTC bros seem blinded by the big numbers and dont understand bigger picture. 

Even btc going straight to 100k today really isnt that spectacular when you think of it as any other stock going from $20 to $100, which is price action all too common in this liquidity driven era",0.9991

The news industry is well...an industry. Big surprise And they are doing theirs job really good Not that it changes the statement, but this is 5 years old. Who actually watches the ‚Äònews‚Äô anymore Wow We need a purge. We need to clear these scum out. We need to clear them all out. We need a fresh start. When you accidentally say the quite part out loud. MSM does not employ or feature journalists...they employ ""personalities"". Those personalities are carefully groomed to attract segments of the population determined by psychological systems and studies to determine the best way to influence those particular individuals based on the reach of any particular personality. It's also a major reason why they feature so many different personalities to deliver ""the news"" in the prospect of reaching many more individuals who ""identify"" with one or more of those on-air personas.. No wonder only boomers watch that shit. The media controls what we think. But what about the fact that there are nations that literally steal money from other governments. Just look at the good old USA. As an American. I'm proud to say that we left Afghanistan and decided to take all their money with us. Here's another one. I don't like your politics (Russia) and what you do. So I'm just going to go ahead and not just sanction you but then freeze all of your assets, take them from you, and then turn around and sell them. No, I'm not a thief. I'm doing it for the good of the world.... This is why crypto is so important. News is a business, they never told the truth and why should they? If you believe on their bs these days that's on you! 
They aren't here to tell the truth, they are here to make üí∞üí∞ The libbys will tell you that you‚Äôre reading into this too much‚Ä¶ if you aren‚Äôt disgusted by this video, watch it again No, an idiot who works in media spilled the beans on what *she* thinks is her job. You're being misleading, which isn't any better than what they're doing.

Also, what the fvck does this have to do with crypto? If you watched the entire show and had any context... what they were talking about was how DJT mind fucked the whole country and she was attempting to say that it is their job as journalists to investigate it and report on it. Obviously not that DJT took their job of brainwashing the country and destroying democracy. OP is misleading you with a 10 second clip with zero context...

Journalism is a vital part of protecting our democracy and attacking journalists with misinformation is exactly what TFG would want you to be doing. Great work OP... Only people watching their show are in this sub... well if you work for popular new sites then yeah its true in part since you are working under governament orders Next week this sub can start posting about trans athletes. You're all going to regret this not keeping these subs apolitical. You'll tank the whole thing What does this have to do with crypto? I doubt a single person on Reddit actually watches Morning Joe. Brilliant! Fuckwits u/BlastingGasses do you mean this? Dafiq And it works. Clearly Someone said ""the news is what we say is the news"" Media is just a propaganda of each faction (dems or gop). They just want u to be a puppet by putting fears on you. That‚Äôs how they get elected. MSM is pure propaganda. Turn off your TV Liberal media. It‚Äôs working honestly. Just look at Reddit.

It should have said: ""Cryptos you should have invested in in the year 2021, or before"" Interesting. People are generally going to have different lists, and that's ok. For me, I'd go with ATOM, SCRT, CRO I understand your concerns, guys, and I thank you ror your inputs. Definitely gonna check out your suggestions. For the list, I specifically chose them because they were the relatively safer bets. Crypto is highly speculative, and with the current market sentiment, we need safe choices. Of course, nobody knows the future, and nobody can 100% predict which coins will provide the best yields, hence the disclaimer. These are already blown projects. Hidden gems like SYLO, SWASH, I believe should come up on lists like this one. I honestly don't care who comes in first because I have 60 percent of the list in my possession, which is quite a fascinating list. Tower and Icons, on the other hand, are in my bag because they have good use cases, are low capped, and have high growth potential. Very good picks, but why do you think both SYS and ALGO are not good for investment? Because from my research they are very good solana is 3rd on this list üòÇ thats funny! Cardano is not even on ur list despite the defi explosion thats going to make ADA one of the most valuable coins in 2022. Buy Vader interesting list you have got up there . seems you missed out on $SYLO because from my end, Metaverse, Web3, Nft are what is trending this 2022 and only $Sylo has got all incorporated . No actual hidden gems here So... not DOT.? I just bought more DOT yesterday. Already ruined 2022. It's a little unusual to see Bitcoin not in the first place in this list. I somehow got used to Bitcoin always being the first. At the same time, SOLANA, in my opinion, deservedly placed in third place. This cryptocurrency showed very good growth in 2021 and probably SOLANA turned out to be my best investment usdt. Interesting. People are generally going to have different lists, and that's ok. For me, I'd go with ATOM, SCRT, SYS and LUXY Xno should be on here, a lot of people struggle to find real world use of cryptos, but xno‚Äôs ultra low fees let‚Äôs me micro pay my friends for all kinds of things.  

Vvs , hop on the crypto com band wagon with their first cronos coin , if you believe in CRO, why not believe in their products

How do you not have lrc? 

Sol is corporate trash 

Theta has so much potential, odd you left that one out too Anyone hold of heard much of Jacy they seem to be doing solid things. Is this satire or a history paper?

But I'd go for Bricktrade's BRKT for now üòÑ Really surprised I didn't see ALBT there, taking into context the number of products they are launching this year I believe they deserve a spot as the products launch would create more utility to the token and you know what's happens next....

2,My goal with crypto is to have a secure life with me and my family and get out of poverty.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v2c6rd/my_goal_with_crypto_is_to_have_a_secure_life_with/,"As some backstory, I worked 48 hours a week and there are times I get severely stressed and there are times I get high fevers. Even if I am not feeling well, people at the company tell me to show up or don't bother coming in anymore. I didn't have a choice; I couldn't find another job, so I put up with it all because I needed to pay my bills and eat.

That job was a mental nightmare for me every day. The whole company itself is toxic. Before I resigned, I made sure I had enough and invested some crypto and stocks and mutual funds. Fast forward today I found a better high paying job that was loads better than my previous job. Not only that, my crypto earnings had increased even better than my stocks and mutual funds.

With crypto, I want to secure myself and my family with pride. I never want to be in a situation where I have no choice but to put up with anything, and I'm hoping that crypto can help me with that. I also want to invest long term and make sure I don‚Äôt get emotional with the roller coaster ride with all the dips that have been happening in various cryptos. I was an early investor and fortunately it didn't affect me.

I admit there are times where there my thoughts are divided between HODLING or Staking my crypto with [defi protocols](https://app.aave.com/) and/or [crypto staking platforms](https://haruinvest.com/) till I'm confident to rely on my earnings, as well as whatever my future family will be OR selling it off because of the dip (and the news about LUNA) and start living a luxurious life showing off my nice house and new car but I learned that not letting people know your ups and downs of financial status is a lot better.

I'm attempting to train myself to work smarter rather than harder. I just want to get out of this cycle of poverty where I spend the majority of my income on bills, food and the endless cycle of living from paycheck to paycheck.",180,80,False," What about stocks? ETFs? Mutual Funds? Don't just place your eggs in one basket bruh. Diversify. I don't need to have a lot of money; I just don‚Äôt like being poor. But I wouldn't mind being rich as well. Invest in income-producing assets so that you can live off the income while the assets grow. I want enough financial freedom to spend time with my family and do what I want when I want, while also supporting technologies that could potentially do the same for many more people. When lambo though Mine is to get rich.

But in all seriousness, I work as a freelancer so I‚Äôve never really had a pension pot, so my aim is to create one at a relatively fast pace using crypto and also some short term gains to enjoy life with less stress. Good work mate , seems like your making solid progress üëè all the best , and let those goals motivate you !! Hey at least you‚Äôre being honest. I'm going to panic out if I hear ""I'm in it for the tech"" one more time, despite the fact that most people buy to sell higher later. You've decided to invest in crypto for all the right reasons. I hope your earnings allow you to live comfortably! Good luck! Mine too. I'm in crypto for the long haul, not for the quick buck. With crypto, I hope to attain at least one life objective. Many people, I believe, are in your shoes. I wish you all the best. Hope you‚Äôre using a hard wallet or you‚Äôre just saving up money for someone else to take Aren't we all now? Good luck to you sir. That is something I believe most of us desire. Personally, I'd like to retire early. Well good luck. I share your sentiments. I'm hoping that crypto will become the new currency. I‚Äôm looking forward to that future. I'm in the same boat. Of course, becoming filthy rich would be great, but I honestly just want to feel financially comfortable regardless of what I choose to do with my life. That‚Äôs right. fiat mines can be toxic NGL. I just want to make some money. I came for the money and I'm still here for it! I'm tempted to say you have almost gotten it all figured out but then spreading funds across different yield protocols is the safest approach to take when seeking big returns for me and personally, I think Spoolfi is among the lowest risk DeFi platforms to make that possible, given the flexibility it gives users to put their funds through multiple channels without paying gas fees several times and at the same time given optimum yield. I completely agree with you, OP; I feel that everyone wishes the same for themselves and those around them. Mostly this achieved by hard work, upgrading your social and work skills every year, but by all means use crypto in a balanced investment portfolio. You‚Äôre going to want to invest in the stock market, not crypto. Start a business

Crypto isn‚Äôt going to get you out of poverty. I don't think cryptocurrencies are a good instrument for ensuring financial stability. Remember, it's a system where you can only make money by selling at a higher price, and there is no value created in the process. Worse, in systems like Bitcoin you are also paying the miners, meaning that investors lose money overall. And that's not even talking about market manipulation and insider trading.

Crypto is a shitty game and the odds are rigged against small-time investors. Investing in cryptocurrencies can be a side business, but don't make it your main business because there is too much instability in the cryptocurrency market. If you make one mistake, you can lose a lot, if not everything. Unless you can make a very stable and long-term profitable project, but I don't think that's possible. All profitable and losing projects have a time limit. Although I also made a lot of money in crypto, I didn't give up my main business. Isn't it better to make money together with your main business and side business? If you want security and stability crypto is not it Instead you are now more in poverty Welcome to the Pipe dream club. Come and throw your money away. I'm in it too for financial freedom although I get attracted to the tech side more often than not. I like Defi and staking as well. Right now I stake ATOM, NGM, JUNO, CRE and EVMOS via Keplr, and GREEN on the [GreenHouseDEX](http://greenhousedex.com). Next week I will add OCEAN to my staking bag once they release OCEAN V4 on the 8th. Everyone stop working and just buy BTC. You'll be a millionaire in 2 weeks. Elon Musk became the richest when he stopped working and began smoking pot. That is my goal as well. I HODL and I stake as well. I have been holding OCEAN for long now, Bancor staking APY is low, but once V4 launches this month, there will be an incentivized single asset staking from ocean team

NGM has give me a great yield since last year. Staking APY is 23%. ATOM, OSMO, JUNO has all done well for me via passive earning

My stablecoin pool is USDC/USDT on GreenHouseDex 24% APR I wish you every success and lots of luck, that‚Äôs an admirable goal. ü´∂ I guess all of us came in for the same reason. And there are many possibilities. Polkadot is launching Equilibrium, polygon is working faster than ever, avax is hodling up somehow, sol is, apparently, fucked hahah. It all comes down to the perception. And making the right move at the right time Keep at it and don't give up. Financial freedom is closer than you think.

Being active in the crypto space has improved my life in more ways than one and I believe it will continue to do so, for all of us.

I do both HODLING and staking with my crypto assets. The passive income + other benefits I get is really cool and I see this market as an opportunity to accumulate gems that will bounce hard in the bull market.

I don't have much luck with getting in early on projects but I'm hoping my luck will change with FLUID. Aside from the possible price action, FLUID is building a system that will improve liquidity across CeFi and DeFi. This is an ad for Haru invest - I would be skeptical of them for sure. Just remember 99% of crypto was made for the explicit reason of exploiting peoples desperation.",0.9996

DOT is another good project that has been around for a while and has big goals for the future. It is definitely one to buy and hold.",152,66,False," Polkadot [pros](/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v3ygx7/polkadot_is_going_to_enable_so_much_for_the_next/ib14af1/) & [cons](/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v3ygx7/polkadot_is_going_to_enable_so_much_for_the_next/ib14atn/) and related info are in the collapsed comments below. Pros and cons will change for every new post. The polkadot ecosystem is insane because it enables L1 interoperability. I don't think people understand the power of that. I love Polkadot and its ecosystem, but I'm not sure why DOT isn't utilized for gas or what the utility of DOT is other than to secure a parachain and the network. I'll look into it more thoroughly myself. Hello all,

I've dabbled in the top 30 cryptocurrencies, and by far Polkadot is the most promising. As you know, the DeFi market is just starting to emerge. I'm not sure how long it will take for institutions and businesses to incorporate Blockchain technology and defi products, certainly once regulation sets in. In fact, it has been happening now with GameStop, Chipotle, and FIFA etc.

However, currently the market is filled with rugpulls, bad fundamentals, and packs security and interoperability. Polkadot aims to solve both security and interoperability, and unlike Cosmos DOT has a more important function. Polka dots algorithm sets the rate of inflation and rewards, and everyone who holds DOT gets a say on the network, and even projects through crowdloans.

Currently most layer ones don't have a layer 0 that provides both security and interoperability, leaving many projects to either be hacked or exploited through bridges. Take advantage of being early, and focus on what will create a decentralized sector of business. Processing speeds do no matter right now, as NFTs are only being used for I'll purposes. These NFT's instead of being digital art, can be used for storing private information for businesses, and provide security through a Blockchain: which is what Polkadot provides and diminishes the possibility of error in security and interoperability. Once parathreads get released, businesses can license a slot for themselves, keeping information stored etc. 

NFT gaming can also start within the ecosystem, if a project gets enough DOT for a crowdloan then they will have enough demand from DOT holders who funded the project and received DOT rewards as well as the projects native token. An inflation rate helps encourage DOT holders to participate in the ecosystem, and stakers help secure the ecosystem.

I must say, after trying many different staking systems of various projects, ADA, AVAX, SOL, LUNA, and even COSMOS. Staking on Polkadot.js may be more technical, but provides compounding interest, and a clear information of what your asset is doing. To add to the fact, staking cycles through different nominators consistently: allowing for further decentralization between validators.

As a cherry on top, Gavin Wood was a former CTO of Ethereum. He developed Solidity, the Ethereum EVM, and the yellow paper of Ethereum. He was an important member to Ethereums success, and is overlooked compared to Vitalik Buterin: who I respect just as much as Gavin Wood. Personally, I hold both Ethereum and DOT as I don't believe in crypto maximalism, and believe they will both help evolve the space entirely.

The thing with crowdloans is the only risk you put in is the risk of opportunity through staking, typically a lock up for a project is 2 years. But with high risk comes high rewards, and if you make the correct choices you will end up with more than what you would have gotten if you had only staked. You can never lose your DOT in a crowdloan.

DOT is undervalued, and projects are being auctioned for a parachain slot as we speak! Once further development comes to these wonderful projects, we will see the power of the community of Polkadot. 

The system is entirely genius, and is one of a kind. It is both impressive tech, and will come to be an excellent investment. If you want to invest into the future, invest into Polkadot where amazing projects in the future will be built up on, and handled through the community. Ikr, will be supporting polkadot all the way. Just stake and forget about it Dot is definitely a good buy right now, right now It's so undervalued. It reminds me of other projects that can boom also, like Helium for example and CCD that can go 10x in the future. So many discounts, but so little money left in my wallet **:(** I was invested in polkadot for almost 2 years, but just late last year I started looking deeper into it's ecosystem including Kusama! The crowdloand system for parachains leases are great and an amazing hunting ground for gems, but even among high level of competitiveness there is a great deal of partnerships done on the space! One great example is how Unique Network and Equilibrium, which were battling at the same time for a parachain on Polkadot (both won a slot) are partnered now! I really can't understand Polkadot's price right now. It looks a huge bargain! The network is growing strong with quality parachains. Smart contracts (Astar Network, Moonbeam), DeFi (Acala Network, Equilibrium), NFT Chain (Unique Network), Infrastructure (Polkadot). It's getting bigger every year. A lot of development is on going on dot and I'm loving it. I'm particularly keeping my eyes locked on Unique Networks' launch on the polkadot ecosystem this weekend. I think it's going to be a big deal as the community is already all hyped up about this.

I'm holding DOT long-term tho. Big dick investors buy DOT. I've never seen a blockchain game that employs DOT. It‚Äôs as dead as the rest. I'm betting on Cosmos to be the next wave among new projects. No one needs to win Parachain auction before deploying on Cosmos and there are a number of top projects like OSMO, JUNO, NGM, CRE, SCRT already built on it. That‚Äôs why I cannot understand how Polkadot can still be so undervalued right now. I make sure to buy DOT and BTC every month I just want to say that it is still a work in progress and has a lot to prove. IMHO, DOT is my best hold. Love the team, love the tech, and the ecosystem is growing at a nice pace, Love everything about it. Indeed so. I recently learned about the upcoming Equilibrium launch, and the platform seems so comprehensive, being better than even AAVE as far as collateral requirements for loans go. Polkadot is yet to shine, and could be one of the surviving chains in the worst case scenario Love to see this. It seems like most coins these days focus on low transaction charges and neglect security. Part of the reason i roll with CCD, I'd be watching out to see how these changes are implemented on polkadot The potentials that lies with Polkadot is quite substantial. That's why I am essentially confident in Railgun's decision to deploy its privacy smart contract on the chain. In general, the ecosystem is very promising and might as well turn out to be one of the top 5 in the next couple of months. I got to understand Polkadot better through my interactions with Equilibrium, another project that won a slot in the auctions that happened few months ago. Super excited about the direction Polkadot is tilting towards",0.9997

Regarding high APYs, I know [NAGAX](https://invezz.com/news/2022/05/26/nagax-a-crypto-trading-platform-rolls-out-multi-coin-staking-feature/) recently launched their staking service with NGC, [Nexo](https://twitter.com/Nexo) still has high rates, and Celsius has decent percentages.

Just wondering where everyone‚Äôs been parking their money since the CDC incident. Let me know!",77,52,False," Have you heard about Anchor?  Yields 20% on your UST stable coins and it‚Äôs totally safe! Not mine, but I had seen this sheet shared on a previous similar post:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/htmlview In staking NGM on Kepler Chrome extension, APY is 23%.

GREEN on Greenhouse Dex for 30% APR.

PSDN on H2O Data app for 114% APR.

Next month OCEAN will release their single-sided staking program and I will jump on it too. Staking ATOM: 17%, JUNO: 104%, NGM: 23%, OSMO: 65%, SCRT:27% using Keplr browser extension

Staking GREEN on GreenHouseDex 28.89% APR Depends, if you want higher than like 10% you may have to go with a protocol, I'm still using CDC.. You could look into Bybits earn platform, they have a bunch of options. If you like high USDC rates, Voyager is still offering 9%. No lockups or anything like that, just maintain a monthly minimum balance. Their debit card is coming out now and only allows USDC spend, so it lets you save & spend a stablecoin, which is pretty simple. I use RocketPool and im happy with it..Now seems i will even stake my NFT for THOL ,for the first time..got into AngelBlock yesterday, thought it wont go up so dayum fast..minting cost 0.069ETH and some NFTs are sold now for over 10ETH per piece..rarity is best and being early, hope im in luck with the second mint also , thats coming up soon i hope..ppl seem to like their plans in the whitepaper Beefy Finance seems pretty good, although takes a bit more work to set up because it's DeFi.

It uses liquidity pools/pairs mainly, and supports several blockchains.

There are some decent rates, and you can do safer pairs like BTC or ETH to USDC. There are also riskier options at higher rates, but probably buyer beware for those. Not sure you've heard about Spool. It's quite understandable the potential reasons why you may not trust protocols. But what do you think about a protocol that is built by aggregating the top yield generators in such a way that the risks you are concerned about are spread out? I just checked again. There is a middle ware where USDC staking is running at 10% currently and that's what I'm familiar with. Critically assessed the risk models for a long time and I can categorically say that it's worth it, even those it may be lesser than the 12% you were making. I have Rowan staked on Keplr, CTSI staked on Binance. 180% & 40% APR respectively Mostly in stables and waiting to pick up FLD when it hits the market. Doing more staking on Keplr Wallet with ATOM, ROWAN, JUNO, SCRT, OSMO, EVMOS. Recently started staking CTSI on Binance.

The returns are decent for each of these assets. Well I'm using CDC as well and the returns are getting more and more shy! I'm looking for alternatives and DAFI looked interesting but complex as it has synthetic derivatives that would reward you with dtokens. A lot to go down this rabbit hole! I was staking with CDC also, bro. Now I have USDC on Yield, EURx/GBPx on Nexo and I'm staking DAFI on Dafi Protocol. I also have some altcoins like DOT and CAKE on locked staking (120d+) for better rewards. It's on DAFI for me. I get up to 250% plus staking on DAFI protocol. I understand that it's a bear market and prices drop and so do APYs. DAFI got a rewarding system that rewards you more especially for staking long term and through bear times. I prefer POS staking now, most of what I got staked are long term holds (I know I know, holding through a bear marketüò©), but I decided to do a bit of every strategy. 

So I'm mostly staking on the cosmos ecosystem through Keplr wallet, APR differs but very reasonable, SCRT 15%, ATOM 11%, ROWAN 184%, NGM 23% (this by far is the most stable price wise, proud of it).  
I still got other L1 like ProtonXPR staked.

Cons of POS staking is the unbonding period which varies from 14 to 21 days. Hi, have a look at these guys if you are looking to invest your money. They pay out around 8% a month, they use your money to run masternodes. I have a whole write up on them if you are interested‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Only if Hedera's price overcomes a couple big resistances and does not break the $0.19 support level will this be possible. Fears of quantitative easing have sent cryptocurrency markets into a tailspin. 

The slump has been accelerated by ongoing geopolitical tensions in Europe, which has reduced the whole crypto market cap by 1/3rd. The price of Hedera coin is currently 62% below its all-time high of $0.57 set in September 2021. 

At time of writing HBAR is currently prices at $0.21 and it's fair to say it will x4 soon, the reason I'm saying this is because only 2 Weeks ago did the HBAR Foundation start a $100M SIF(Sustainable Impact Fund) which is funding innovators and entrepreneurs who are aiming to build the best DeFi and GameFi Dapps only on Hedera.  

Regardless of the fund, I was able to get some Alpha leaks from one of the HBAR Foundation Podcasts with one of the co-founders and it seems like big news is on the way regarding HBAR and Ubisoft, looks like a major gaming ecosystem is being built.

Pretty sure that happened before the invasion It's not a good thing. 

Crypto was unregulated and thus perfectly legal in Ukraine. Now it is the opposite. Given the reputation of the regulatory body that had been given the responsibility to regulate crypto I do not expect that something good comes out of it. 

Restrictions, unenforceable KYC/AML rules and increased risks of CEXes soon blocking Ukrainian accounts are among the outcomes I expect and prepare to.

I declare air legalized@! I think that this news is bad because it means that the Ukrainian government is endorsing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. I believe that Bitcoin is a bubble and that it is not a sound investment. I also think that cryptocurrencies are a scam and are not a reliable way to store value. That's great to here!! a lot of token will sure pump. i hope MELOS token too when trading is open. Sweet....I'm ready to visit.

The domino effect is happening. Soon all governments and companies will get involved in crypto.

I mean look at Boeing, LG and Google, all of which have become part of the Hedera council and hard helping fund the HBAR foundation with grants to improve the Hedera ecosystem I thought this wasn't a new story. It's been legal in the country for a while. Probably I missed something. Let's go. This is why bitcoin and cryptocurrency Is important and more in this dark times. Decentralization is a key factor for moving money without intermediaries like banks, who only know how to screw people. 

The metaverse is also really important for the future and governments will have to get in touch with it. That's why we should be ahead and invest in metaverse projects like Kitty Inu and it's native token $kitty.

I know countries like India are pushing hard against crypto. Other countries like Turkey and Singapore have begun initiating rules and legislations to block it. Some countries like The United States are holding conferences to discuss its implementation. This is all good news, whether it is good or bad. 

If they are stopping crypto, good. It means they are afraid of it and its potential. History has proven that when the people are held back from something, they are most often more so drawn to it with more passion than ever. If they are pushing for it, good. It means it‚Äôs working and they can no longer fight against it further, it means crypto users will be ahead of the curve in a system the world will all adopt. 

This will show best at NFT usage. Hear me out here. I know NFTs for now are just images sold without any actual use than just, looking at them. They are already evolving. Some NFTs like the Royal Falcons Club reward users uniquely with a new and innovative system. Other NFTs are being used for ownership claims and proof of singularity.

Nothing about this is new except, that they can accept lightning payments now on Shopify, not that they are.

Once a company announces they‚Äôre accepting btc with lightning payments get excited otherwise this is a completely fake and misleading news headline.

Also there is a 2% fee on the buyers side and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs slippage/spread on strike as well even tho the fanboys will argue there isn‚Äôt, the consumer is looking at atleast a 3% fee.  Good luck disputing a charge  if there‚Äôs an issue on a purchase. Lightning is like a clunky, user unfriendly altcoin, there is no point to it while BTC doesn't have L1 capacity to use it without custodial solutions. So let them move to El Salvador and Honduras and Russia to exploit their customer base! 99% of the people who made it in crypto rose from the ashes of a 3 year bear market, real traders pray for real bear market because it is called shopping time. [deleted] This is stupid. BTC is being integrated directly within ICP, which is a real blockchain with lower fees and faster transactions and less complexity than lightning. Besides, lightning is just a rehash of nostro vostro tech from 1970, it's not a blockchain. People that give up on BTC now might soon feel like the bloke that bought Pizza with 10,000 BTC.

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",7,32,False," What's good here guys? I hope everyone had a pleasant weekend, and is ready for new victories so to say!! Me myself, I'm looking forward to finally be able to mint these Honeyland bees. Been part of the community for a while now, and excitement is huge ahead of the mint date, set to start on 1st for select users. Any projects having some events you are looking forward to this week? Well the week started with a sign of commodities' markets rebound - even though US is closed - crypto got the message and will close Monday with a big green candle;  
That's a good sign for the rest of the week, we're looking at a potential 20% upward move. It's been a great start because of the green charts, but I know we should not get fooled by this. For now, I'm looking into different cryptos and Nfts that are about to launch on Polygen. Been holding PGEN for these whitelist events. Hey everyone, 
When looking looking at new projects, what makes you want to move forward with it? What kind of research does everyone do?
Thanks! Hi, is Bitzoher.com is safe ?  
My father won 0.5BTC and was directed on this broker. They ask for a huge deposit (0.01BTC) in order to withdraw what we have on an other wallet (Binance in this case).  
  
I don't want to mess with so many money, and I've only mined ETH directly to sell it on Binance.

I have this when I try to withdraw https://imgur.com/vbmNYM2 Apperantly i got no karma . Boost me up Scotty I got opinons that matter. Loopringüíô I'm looking for the best exchange.

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",11,29,False," . Charles Hoskinson just sounded the alarm from Washington that Bitcoin maxis are actively trying to legislate away proof of stake in favor of laws to help Bitcoin. This type of behavior is toxic and anathema to what Bitcoin was founded on. The solution is not to ban competition. Maxis are toxic for the entire asset class and should be named and shamed for this behavior. What is happening to alts right now is a direct result of this.

Link: https://youtu.be/gHOO_fP75aM?t=1295 if i short usdt with 20x leverage isnt it free money ? its guranteed that it wont go higher then 1 dollar but it will likely go lower I am pretty new to all of this so can someone explein why is literally everything going down? Hypothetically‚Ä¶.if one were to have their seed phrase/ keys stolen and viewed their crypto on-chain be washed through a series of privacy coins and mixers how does the government determine if this person was legitimately stolen from or if it was the owner of said crypto acting intentionally to avoid tax? (This is assuming the initial purchase of crypto was through a KYC‚Äôd exchange) Am I the only one who feels like a project that doesn't require any investment but your steps is worth a try? The name is sweatcoin and I hope I am not the only one What's up guys, how come it's so quiet here lol? I'm searching for some new P2E options, fps would be the best if possible. Atm, I like Honeyland, as it resembles COC, a game I truly enjoyed playing back in the day. Do tell if you have any suggestions I just read the information, there are many platforms to support #Luna back. What do people think about this? Billy Markus, Dogecoin DOGE co-founder, says LUNA 2.0 will show the world just how truly dumb crypto gamblers really are.‚Äô LUNA 2.0 will go live on May 27th, 2022. Given the recent UST de-peg & LUNA collapse, do you agree with BillyM2K that buying LUNA 2.0 is a dumb idea? [Idoru.capital](https://Idoru.capital). Anyone heard of this yet? they were at a Convention i was at and had a ton of startups asking them for funding, rather than seeking investors themselves. Anyone have any insight on how this Fund of funds mirror works? r/Exorde  is a web3 protocol that empowers developers to scrape and link all public data on the web Solution from fake news.please DYOR Is there a telegram group where people discuss TA? U guys gonna pick up some luna 2 after the airdrop sell off? Anyone else things we could be pulling up soon enough? I had a pretty rough month, but managed to endure, and even add to all of the bags I wanted to. Now I am looking at minting Honeyland NFT's, and becoming a true part of the hive.

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",8,34,False," Any news on the Terra Luna jazz? Every time the weekly volume of bitcoin got really high, we eventually saw a reversal in the trend. This happened in Jan 2015, Dec 2018, Mar 2020, and May 2021. Does anybody think the high volume this week may lead to an uptrend soon? I have staked ada and ethereum 2. I feel like it‚Äôs the safest play right now. What does everyone else say? I'm currently earning 0.429 ETH per month, via staking 140 ETH @ 3.68% APR in ETH2 rewards. Stack (BTFD), stake and HODL ETH to riches!!! GLTA!!! go check IXFI crypto project is too cool. Zoom Session

Anyone wanna hop on a zoom session and breakdown some trades live? If so just shoot me a message if this isn‚Äôt allowed just delete üëçüèΩ Not sure if anybody has used this exchange, but long story short I was trying it out with small money over the past few months and was going well. Then I made a big profit and that became the problem. They don't tell you upfront that they want you to pay a 10% tax to transfer your money, or two different id verification that cost 3k/5k. Now I get to become homeless because I can't pay the taxes and move the money since I did not know any of this upfront with them and getting them to explain what the hell was going on was a nightmare, although that might be partly due to the language barrier. Yes some of this could be done better by me and I fucked it up and some of it was just shit timing as I lost my job and savings shortly after this entire event. Hope this can at least help someone else even if it is what kills me in the process.

Sorry that got long and turned into a rant but I needed to get that out there and off my chest yeah Taking long positions might be a good choice personally for me in my analysis and put a stop loss under the small consolidation(daily chart) Who are the current buyers of UST and why do they think the price will go up? So, I just started to buy crypto however have been looking at it for awhile now. anyone else look at the new Nekocoin that just came out? Ethereum preparing a 'bear trap' ahead of the Merge ‚Äî ETH price to $4K next?  
Ether's price could reach $4,000 by 2022's end...

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",220,182,False," [removed] Can someone explain why everything is down? Hello, I‚Äôm a big fan of crypto and I have a big faith in the market. Im in my late 20s with steady income from my software engineering job. However, the only portfolio I have is 401k, I was thinking that I would withdraw half of my 401k (of course with including the withdrawal penalty..) and put it towards crypto and coins that I believe, and have potentially 2 assets. What do you guys think about this? [removed] BTT anyone? Got into the market in November thinking it was a great time to get started. Had that same feeling every day since LoL Hi API3 will retest $9.50 today during Bidens speech today, like last time [removed] likely to see bitcoin sub 20k if SPY drops another 10% today, followed by sub 10k if another red day in a row - just look at march 2020 and this war business is far greater risk. I'm holding Putin personally responsible for my ""Red"" portfolio! Imagine being a community manager without enough karma. That's my life. Help me get some guys. :D This is the time for passive income, only alt you should be accumulating should be one with good staking APY with less risk like ORE token.Dyor Derivatives vs proof of work. Which has more influence? What influence do each have? It would be so great if oracles like LINK, BAND, DIA could get that spark they need in order to flip trend. They are one of the projects in crypto with reasonable utility and I hope they find their foot in the next leg up. very nice very nice [removed] Has Meme season finally ended? Will Fundamentals and utility take way.   
Is the era of social media influence and hype halted by the precipice of  
 mass adoption coming.  I think we are still decades away from seeing   
the true potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I mean  
 life changing applications and possibilities are being developed right   
before our eyes. I'm excited to see who and what survives long term and   
plan to play the long game. I have never had the means or luck to risk a  
 meme token or micro cap, but a 10 or 20x would be so helpful in the   
mean time. I DCA bi weekly for the long term and slowly learned to trade  
 with small amounts on the side. I think after 3-5 years in crytpo,   
numerous losses, watching charts, following trend and patterns, staying   
up to date with news, reading white papers, and watching so many videos   
on YouTube they all became the same monotonous narrative of repetitive   
""not"" shilling  unbiased content, I'm ready to dabble a little more   
avidly of my own accord. I can see the trends repeating and it looks   
like a promising future. Hope you guys survive and are ready for ride. Market is Red, but Juno was ATH last night.  
It is so strong trend as I think. Expect new airdrops in near future. Putin Token is the only one you could buy in this crysis.

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",31,63,False," XTZ is pumping guys! Get on if u still can. $SHIB AND $DOGE üöÄ This week I am holding onto  my UST and playing the current market by exchanging cryptos that have had a good run, for cryptos with strong fundamentals and which are yet to join the rally. My  Main trade this week was exchanging 20% of my Luna for Juno. NO I am not partial to only cosmos projects, I do follow &hold DOT and Avax too, but Luna, Juno, Atom, Akash is where I see the max potential in coming months Anyone else worried about the lack of volume leading into this rally? **I spent 5 hours analyzing Goldfinch. Here are my findings.**  
Last weekend, I spent a big chunk of my Saturday doing a deep-dive blog post into Goldfinch. What I found:

* Unsecured lending (the problem Goldfinch is solving) is interesting, but Goldfinch's innovation is business model innovation, not technical innovation.
* Goldfinch lowers the risk of unsecured lending in 3 ways: 1) Business borrowers only; 2) On-chain human Auditors, and 3) Backers. The key is 1) Business borrowers.
* In other words, Goldfinch picks the least risky borrowers

Is this good or bad? 3 conclusions:

* Conclusion 1: Goldfinch acts as a middleman between different lending businesses. It is unlikely to revolutionize it.
* Conclusion 2: One can do a fundamental analysis of Goldfinch's value, based on the amount of outstanding loans and number of borrowers.
* Conclusion 3: If you are a yield-farmer, Goldfinch offers probably a more stable, easy-to-understand returns with lower risk than many DeFi projects out there. If you are looking to buy $GFI (the governance tokens), be wary of regulatory risk.

Full version of my analysis: https://www.dantehq.com/article/BDhj9\_KYH37wjuHMRYVOCs/lending-without-collateral-a-primer-for-goldfinch Check out this post for small cap gem picks. Easy profits over the next bulk cycle!
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/trw1vj/small_cap_kucoin_gems_to_plant_a_seed_in/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share I love to get some educated thoughts on eight coin at its current almost $14 price? I only recently became aware of it and I'm assuming I'm extremely far behind. As I usually am. Just wondering if it may be worth it to grab a small amount? I'm accumulating low-cap stocks because they have a lot of growth potential, and the market is showing some signs of life here and there. Last year, I made quite a fortune simply by holding TOWER, though I did lose holding some others but gained overall. I recently added some DKT, NII, MPL, and CVP to my bag in order to be well prepared for the next bull run. LRCüíô moon soon!! Shiba army ? The technicals provide some insights; it looks like 45600 is strong support for BTC, and if it does not break it in the near term, we can see a new high soon.

What is your thought on the technicals of the benchmark coin? Anyone wanna try a new cryptobot? I‚Äôve been consistently getting good return from it. Are we really entering a real alt pump or does bitcoin still need to fully correct before we go big? The TA says It needed to dip down to around 30k before heading to all time highs again. Love to hear your thoughts? Best TA books for beginners? Im balls deep in Cro and XRP with no exit strategy , I had a dream last night that one of my alt coins mooned and I earned ‚Ç¨1,357,388 as I began to login to cdc app to check which one I woke up.... Stellar XLM fans check out the sdexexplorer, it's like a coin market cap but for all the tokens on Stellar Network. Read the interesting write-up on why traders may be keeping tabs on BTC price movement. I'm quite sure every trader would be anticipating a climb in price of BTC from the 44.5k test zone in the coming days. Whether this would happen as expected in the coming days is still a big question however. Market influences on the asset haven't been quite distinctive lately. But then, the next one or two weeks could reveal a lot. Anyone's thoughts on evergrow?

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",70,101,False," To all collectors and investors, #UNICRED was created for you, especially for those who want to earn passive income and incentives. Putting your time and money into # UNICRED will not be in vain. It provides users with a smooth lending experience and prevents security issues. Whatever happened with the Flare/XRP drop? Any updates? Are they waiting for the lawsuit to complete? Curios to know where everyone is staking their stables and earning passive rewards? I'm currently doing that with the BlockBank app and getting a pretty decent APY. does any else also look at projects with fundamentals too? I think subsquid can make its mark too as they are helping so many projects already. The best part is that they are looking for global ambassadors too and one can become part of their dao by doing easy community quest. I'm just curious as to how everyone is faring with this dip! Would it be smart to convert some of my crypto into stable coins incase of a big drop? Similar sentiment than in Q3 2018 at the moment. Back then you could have bought QNT for 50 cents. And right now you get another chance to buy some real gems (longterm holds) at the bottom. There are a few strong coins that are completely oversold and unnoticed, sitting at All-Time-Low presale prices.
BrightUnion is one of them. 

Also keep an eye on Radix (XRD), a L1 that will become the SOL of the next bullrun. (2023) Hey all weird request here however I am looking for 26 pence ( 0.00095  )worth of BNB so I can transfer some tokens off pancakeswap . As I am from the uk I am not able to readily get BNB.

One of the problems of DeFi is the issue of TVL under-utilization. Still, with Lever Finance, this will bridge the gap by matching leverage traders with lenders within their platform and will allow users to maximize the value of their yield-bearing collateral to go either long or short at up to 10x leverage with just one-click.

Projects like NEAR and ICP have better tech and aren't down every couple of days. Solana is an embarrassment to the industry. Sometimes I wonder why Solana NFTs and tokens can't seem to get a foot on the ground, and now I see it. As beautiful as the tech is in Solana, they won't grow if they don't fix their vunerabilites. I now see why popular NFTs like Quint NFT and some others chose BSc over it Can a serious L2 launch on Solana before fixing their downtimes and vulnerabilities? No. Thanks for coming to my TEd talk. And Quint NFT, is anybody holding one around here? Solana has the most vulnerability of all the frenzied blockchains. A narrative they won't want to stick to. It might be why some of its NFTs are not performing to their full potential.

Is there any screener or setting that would help me find unusual volume coins from the week BEFORE? Thanks Who here can enlighten me about on-chain leveraged trading platforms? Just finished reading about Lever Finance (it's the rebranded version of RAMP DeFi). And, they'll be operating an on-chain leveraged trading platform, where users can enjoy up to 10x trading capital. Based on the write-up, it'll be easier to acquire Bitcoin, Ethereum, or BNB. In short, the major assets. I'm keen on getting more of them this year. That's why I'm particularly interested in this rebranding.

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",17,85,False," I wonder if you guys talk about a Defi project that help investors to have big advantage in the market. KOlnet does that thing for its  set to revolutionize crypto marketing by incentivizing Key Opinion Leaders and effectively marketing projects through Initial Marketing Offerings.

Hoping this will be included in the discussion for others to know about its potential as a Defi project! I'm getting increasingly tired of trading cryptocurrency, or trying to. I'm not necessarily saying I want to give up entirely, because I've put too much energy into trying to learn it to begin with. I don't know if all platforms are like this, but Binance makes it such a painful process and people say this is just your standard exchange platform, or one of the best. 90% of my investments are made with a misleading graph, where I think the price will go up in a day or so but in reality (CoinMarketCap) they end up being potentially months away from going back up.

And in general, fees. To actually break even, the price needs to go up massively, so you're potentially waiting months anyway.

I bought a Udemy course to help me learn, but it feels like every single video in it is just saying ""buy low, sell die, here's a graph, I am rich, buy low sell high, here's a graph, I am rich"", with clickbait titles throughout, so you click on it thinking it'll be a gem of information, but he's just repeating the same generic outdated nonsense.

I'm so stressed right now.

If anyone can give me some tips based on my rant, I'd be willing to try again. The course I mentioned above didn't really go into much detail at all about how to actually do DeFi, which apparently helps with the fee problem. I wish we had easier ways of moving cryptocurrency. In some places they banned Binance, and it makes investing in coins for dips a lot more difficult. Anyone looking into staking stables? Just wanted to say you can try out BlockBank, been using it for a while now and the experience has been good. Both USDT and USDC staking available uh may i ask why this place is riddled with bots? Also is this the place where crypto discussions happen aside from cryptocurrency STEPN / GMT going up really nice since introduction at binance launchpad. Has somebody  else joined the trading? I hope this time I get out with profit before it crashes to trash ü§° i dont know if i can post this here, but does anyone know about webit? (webitbvhybb.com) and short term trading? desperately need help. thank you in advance Do most people agree that the market is very similar feeling technically just prior to the 50% correction in 2018? What are your thoughts about APE? Is it worth the hype? With Crypto, for me, it's always a tug of war between - this is a bubble (given that 90% of investors don't read / understand the white paper and invest due to FOMO) vs there is real value. How do you get over your fear of the possibility of jumping on the wrong bandwagon? GMT and jasmyü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ Ive been buying and trading crypto for a while and was wondering what you can tell me about Tether and USD coin.

Hedera foundation recently gace a grant to DOVU to help buildout their carbon credit marketplace.  The  arbon credit market is set ro explode in the next few years and DOVU is using DLT to verify carbon credits.

Impressively it is my best investment ironically. what‚Äôs the safest crypto to buy right now? What are you thoughts about btc ? I see the market at the support line getting ready to grow. I've bought the dip but I just sold 2/3 of my portfolio. Have a hard time believing we just keep going up now in a straight line.

 Especially because any day could be the day Biden announces new crypto regulations.

What you think? Metaloop is the next gem of metaverse projects...available on pancakeswap, listed on CMC and CG, staking is live, NFT's and P2E games are coming soon...so don't regret in future go for metalooptech (MLT) Is Kucoin scamming its users with the ""New listings"" feature?
  
I always wondered how it can possibly be that nearly any coin that is listed there has a price surge of 50%+.
I just saw the green candle and was like ""okay, must be true"".
But I now double checked the price history with other sites like coingecko and the stated gains of kucoins always were false.

They will be creating their native Blockchain protocol, that would allow cross-chain operation capability. What does this mean for users? It means that their asset bridges would be able to cater more networks at one time, so transactions would become much faster.

  
Building on the existing issues in different protocols, they are set to resolve the Blockchain trilemma of scalability, fragmentation, and high transaction fees. To do so, they will be using Polysharding. It allows faster transactions at lower fees, without sacrificing security and decentralization. It's nice to see more competitors in the market trying to better the existing ones. It would be a shame to miss out on this platform!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pq-4VAUm1Y Juno going to overtake Atom in price soon. Crazy to think it was just 1/10th the price four months ago ü§Ø Everyone here needs come have a look at croking you get paid cro for just holding obviously do your own research it's on the Cronos network defi wallet buy through mmf or crodex Happy Sunday! A question to all the financial and crypto experts: if you were to make your first step in cryptotrading TODAY, where would you invest your first $1k (as of Feb. 6th, 2022)?  #cryptocurrency  #cryptotrading #finance #cryptocoin #advice my macro-view:  axie infinity isn't going anywhere anytime soon.  
my micro-view: the SLP token is the ""dollar"" of the axie ecconomy and the AXS token is like a ""bond"".  the devs. manipulate the ""printing"" of more SLP tokens based on how players are gaming the system.  every season (i think 3 or 4 months) they reset the leaderboards and adjust the token awards based on how the economy is growing.  since the SLP token is the main way to ""earn"" in this game, i think it should be worth anywhere between $0.01 and $0.10.  granted it'll pump and dump further depending on macro situations but, if i can snag some under $0.01 and the narrative is right, it's usually a pretty dang good return.  i've literally been watching the price action for 10-months now (back when it pumped below $0.01 up to $0.20 and then up to $0.30) and personally think it's one of the safest rides to the moon if you get the timing right.  because again, axie isn't going away anytime soon.  and the devs are OG's in the space.

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",20,623,False," Has anyone on here heard of Hedera HBAR, because I‚Äôve never seen a post about it, which is strange as it‚Äôs the future for believers in crypto. Where should I be buying Cryptocurrencies? 

I have a few thousand dollars worth on Robinhood but don't really trust it. 

I'd like to make crypto a bigger part of my portfolio but don't know what market it exchange to use. 

I want access to smaller coins as well. POLKER and NEAR  are great , the projects working on themselves to improve their gaming performance ! They are not dull as other project ! Still they are trying to come up with awsome updates like 3D character with VFX graphics What are good discords to talk crypto intra day price movements and technical analysis? This is the more popular now, but this project will be most popular in the world that is a very useful thing. Most powerful project of the crypto world polker_PKR
 receiving everyone's attention on every step. That's why its best in metaverse
No doubt that polker_PKR  is rocking in every step definitely going to the moon NFT PKR [removed] ACH made some gains yesterday but cam down overnight.  I'm expecting it to go .50-.75, what do you think? If you are looking for the next big L1 project in crypto:
100% Radix (XRD, eXRD) deserves your attention.

Most of the current L1s have mooned already because of VC backed shills (Avax, Sol, Ftm, Near, Rose, Luna, Dot, Hbar ... ). None of them has the tech to stand out. All with decent ecosystems and some cool Dapps, but are they future proof and ready to scale into millions of smart contract TPS? I highly doubt it. Radix is currently the only L1 that has solved the fundamental issue of DLTs: You lose atomic composability when you implement sharding for scaling. And Radix does sharding like no other DLT, with an unlimited number of shards.

Do some research on Dan Hughes. He is the brain behind Radix and potentially the next Vitalik of the DLT space. Top 5 coin 2023. And i shilled QNT below $1 here in 2018. 

Sorry if you think this is a cheap shill. If people didn't mention projects like Radix early on Reddit, 4chan or Twitter, before they achieve any mainstream hype, we all wouldn't find gems at lower prices. A quick analysis of the overall crypto market

NFTs are buzzing currently which makes it a perfect time for the public sale of the Yolo parrots collection from pNetwork happening this month. SAND and HypeX are another exciting ones too. Guys, honest review about OCEAN protocol? Is it really a good buy currently? During times like these, it's good to be diversified. I'm still DCAing into everything.

We are a group of bitcoin lovers who share crypto info & signals. Hey all. 

I'm looking to get into crypto trading and I'm using Binance as I'm in Sweden. I wanted to know if there are good resources to get started and what should I do to get started? I have an idea of the stock market, but I want to know how do I watch the markets of say Shiba/Doge/Bitcoin. Is there a social media handle or something that can give me breaking alerts? There are some rumors that the checklist of PKR will lead to a surge in the token‚Äôs value. PKR is a necessary element of Polker and is a cross-chain utility token that allows holders to get entry to distinctive elements on its gaming metaverse have a look at it... Hey guys, a mid-low cap gem is showing itself and I think it‚Äôs now or never to make some easy money. It‚Äôs Syscoin, it has great tech and compared to even the big layer 1s out performs them in every way. In the long term hard to see anything less than a 20x I tried to buy $25 of baby doge. The gas fee was $152. Is that normal? Hey lads, a question here:  
I want to buy alt-coins with BTC rather than USD. As I understand, it happens by trading satoshies, mini-Bitcoins, so to speak.  
Is there a page or data where I can look at and calculate/see results of what target entry I should have in satoshies for an alt-coin instead of USD?  
Hope the question is clear. The likely reason for crypto markets bouncing today, 3 minute video hope you enjoy!

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",25,286,False," Great discussion When lambo? I just got a laptop and I was looking for any crypto sites to play around with?! Whether it‚Äôs exchanges, games, audio platforms, I wanna get more experience and hands on knowledge in this space so any recommendations? Crypto is more aligned with the main indexes more than ever.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq just marked their largest comebacks since the 2008 financial crisis.

With inflation and all other crap happening it just seems off. This market crash which is bringing crypto down with it is due to a decade of catastrophic US Federal Reserve policy.

 80% of all us dollars in existence ever since its inception was printed in the last 2 years. We had 4 trillion usd in circulation up until January 2020. By December 2021 that's now sitting at 20 trillion plus.

Of course were going to have inflation. Worse, most of that printed dollars go to those who are already the top 1%.

Were all fucked because of the US because every nation in this planet uses dollars to trade oil. The rest of the world did not vote for fucked up policies like this, the American people did.

So any non American stock and crypto holder is getting fucked again by Americans just like how their 2008 housing bubble crisis and unfettered consumerism fucked the rest of the world.

American bros, please stop voting in idiots like trump or senile old men like Joe. Oh wait, you don't have any god options because the Democrats and republicans have a farce right vs left war which the voters eat up when in reality its the big corpos who are the puppeteers.

Enjoy!",12,298,False," Hey man I have been looking for something cheap but promising to invest in and I am a beginner so I don‚Äôt know to much about all this can you help me? Would you guys suggest to a friend who lost a lot of money in leverage trades to swith to option tading ?

I mean, I'm not a big game trader, i get the concept and if some info comes buy i try it out.  
Would you agree that option trading is safer then leverage, cause I suggested him to check out Siren protocol, where they have most if not all erc20 pairs for you to use and abuse :) What‚Äôs happening with SHIB rn?!

The whitelisting literally ends tomorrow and the sales start the day after. Looks very promising to me. Anyone else anticipating? Where are y'all staking ETH? 

I think BlockBank app is really great, got to know about it recently and it offers up to 10% for ETH staking. Also heard some persons suggest Kucoin and Binance but seem APY is lower there. Guys the next trend is building up, the data and asset management niche is becoming stronger every minute and some project are worth investing now that they are cheap, ORE protocol seems as such and it's still very much undervalued. hey everyone :)

Stands for Totally A Rug Pull.
The name is ironic because their project and product is a system that is AI-based which detects suspicious behavior in contracts and gives detailed alerts when a contract or a token may be a rug pull.
Those guys are super invested in it to a point that they hire people from the community and opened a pretty big office in Netherlands to turn this into more than just a side project.
I highly encourage everyone to take a look at it, as they're trying to solve a problem we're all suffering from these days

Green candles for Request network! Did anyone of you get to buy RIDE during it's public sale or simply waiting for listing like I'm now? RIDE will do some really good numbers once it's listed I believe. Is anyone else here invested in Polkadot (POL)?

Now its on a price of 36.00$ but I hear its going to rise up between 250.00$ and 500.00$.

Im not sure if it will hit the 500$ but a rise isn't that improbable.

What are your thoughts? [removed] What do you think about LTO and JED? Anyone invested in those? Any chance I can get some comment karma to be able to post meaningful posts? Everything will be fine. Btd & go take a nap. :) I have been following the market for a year.  I bought BTC a week ago.  Now -10% of the balance. Anyone hear of 24stockoptionstrade.com? Is it a scam?

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",16,394,False," how high do you guys see CRO going? Do you think they have an announcement planned for the staple center on Christmas? Where can I buy new cryptocoins released easily like we buy on major exchanges(I find swaps uneasy)?? any current or upcoming projects i should keep my eye on? Hey guys,
I am relatively new to the world of crypto and trading, so I am looking for an advice from more skilled traders. I have been searching for a trading platform with a lot of new/small altcoins that has reasonable fees when it comed to buying and trading. Any tips?

Thanks a lot guys! ETH, BTC and more are going down, what do you plan to buy? Other than the two, what do you think has potential to grow in the future and it deserves buying now at a decent price? Look at Gitcoin (GTC) Idk where to post sub meta but why is 90% of comments of every post auto removed??? [removed] [removed] [removed] Why is there abit of a crash ? Any reason ? How do people know what to buy and what platform do people use i only have coinbase atm and bitcoin and eth [removed] Id buy if it goes to 58 or 52 What wallet is best for Tezos?

I'm in Australia, and I currently use Coinspot. I was comfortable giving over ID details for KYC as they're regulated locally.  
  
I'm looking to buy Starl token (metaverse project), and as ETH fees are so high on Uniswap and other DEX's, I'll need to set up on another exchange in order to buy regularly. They've provided a list of exchanges the token is available on, but I'd like to see which ones people think are the safest to use. I'm a little cautious about handing over KYC to an offshore exchange.  
  
OKEx  
  
Gateio  
  
MEXC  
  
AOFEX  
  
Bitrue  
  
BKEX  
  
LBANK  
  
Hotbit (I've read this one's kinda dodgy)  
  
CoinEx (I've read this is a scam)  
  
  
  
Looking forward to some advice! [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] [removed] Why is that global markets show a 2% decline in the price of BTC but Indian apps like WazirX and Coin DCX show 10-15%?

Disclaimer: I'm new to actually investing in the market, but have watched developments of it for a few months before putting my own money in it. But I'm making this comparison by looking at CRO vs other exchange tokens.

  
1-most of the other exchanges' tokens are way more valuable at this point.

  
2-Crypto.com has been GROWING it's trade volume at a greater rate then others (it's newer so that is a reasonable expectation). 

3- as a new investor in Crypto, Crypto.com is obviously going to be on more people's radar immediately than others. 

4-They have been pumping a lot I to their marketing....they have more skin in the game.  


5-They don't stop at marketing though. They have been doing the regulatory stuff to be ""legit"". For instance, they just got a certification for security that no other exchange has Crypto Announcement To me this is a sign that they are positioning themselves to not be a flash in the pan after the Staples Center deal or getting Matt Damon on as a spokesman.  
  
Circle back to point 1 (other exchanges' tokens are worth more)....I see that as a temporary situation. I think CRO is positioned to be a good grower, as the exchange is positioned to be a key player to take the market to the mainstream.  
  
So, I think the buy is a good one (as it is now around $0.75-0.80).

For me it is just clear that normally asset classes become more correlated during downturns/ crises. Especially risk-on assets like equities, commodities. but crypto should more behave like a safe-haven asset like gold or treasuries,,,, I am not understanding the feedback loop that leads to this crypto downturn.

Why is LTC not MUCH more popular and higher priced?!?

Good price appreciation, long-term track record, super low fees, fast transaction time.

I don‚Äôt get it, can anyone explain this? üòÑ Does anyone knows wtf with Olympus & wonderland? The APY they offer it's insane. Can't be true

Is it going to be another up +100% kind of day today? How dyall deal with the fact that all the cryptos trade together? When Bitcoin drops or spikes, all the other major ones do as well. Do you trade pairs? What is the current state of these both trading platforms? I have read numerous bad things about both Binance and Coinbase (such as Binance being banned by MasterCard and Maestro, Coinbase being reported as non-legit website on many VPN providers...)

[removed] Anyone knows Reflecto Coin? [removed] .. Anyone notice the incorrect values for Total Market Cap and BTC/ETH dominance on CoinMarketCap this evening?

Just went to look at my watch list on CoinMarketCap and noticed the total crypto market cap shown at just over $1T... Panic initially went through me for a second as I briefly wondered ""did all the alt coins get dumped""... But then I immediately thought, ""wait a second, there can't be that much volume on exchanges to drop the whole crypto market by 60%+ in a few hours""... Then I looked closer at my watch list and saw that 5 of the top 10 add up to $2T+ on their own... And the ticker at the top for BTC/ETH dominance added up to 163%+ (bonkers)  
  
So, CoinMarketCaps total values are totally messed up... And so is the chart it links to... The chart is even better for generating a false heart-attack...  
  
Never noticed this kind of discrepancy before...

What do you all use? A small tip to a beginner can go a long way! Thanks! [removed] If I pool to tokens, then put them in a pool, then I get rewards which i use to top it up i the  pool (which leads to compound interest) will the rewards that i top it up with, adjust to the new price of the tokens in the liquidity pool? If so, will I then have a smaller chance for a huge impermanent gains happening since there are theoretically a smaller difference between the tokens when i withdraw? 

This seems to good to be true.. Hi All, what is the best software/platform to use to get real time data on micro cap altcoins and apply indicators for trading? I've been using dextools but I think I'd prefer a software client.

When I check them on dextools they have already pumped hard, usually starting 15 mins ago (in this example) or whenever they were supposed to have been first listed.

Binance Chain Wallet

I just learned how to convert US Dollars for Tether(USDT) in order to purchase other kinds of crypto. With this one ending in BNB, am I able to just use USDT to purchase or do I need to convert to whatever BNB is?

I have wallets on both Robinhood & Binance.US. Are any of those compatible with those 3 apps? If so, which one do you's think would be the best one to use(safest)?

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",23,392,False," whats up with LRC I‚Äôm loving it. I turned 1 btc into 4 in 6 days over last weekend. Best trade ever for me. $202k net gain Just bought $25,000 in OXT. It‚Äôs gonna to hit $1 by Tuesday! Wink wink Anyone else looking forward to the RIDE public sale on Maiar launchpad? It's happening on the 26th and it could be one to keep on the radar. Wow ! What is happening with Litecoin? Can someone explain? Loopring is going ballistic ü§Ø still a tiny market cap too Hello I am new First of all, I'd like to thank the Mods here. With a new account it's almost impossible to built Karma that is needed to be allowed to post in the Crypto related subreddits. At least here you can talk in the weekly thread. To try and built up some Karma. I understand the reasoning behind the rules here and on other crypto subreddits to have this rule. But it is slightly frustrating some times. As I'm not looking to spam or shill or what ever. I just like to talk about Crypto. Anyway, on topic.

I was looking at the chart of my coins yesterday. And I saw the forming of a Wycoff Pattern. But we where still all the way up. So I was pretty sure we would see a (massive) dip. Or maybe call it a correction. So the best strategy would have been to sell all my coins. And then wait for the dip to buy back in the market. But I didn't. In fear I'd be wrong. Clearly I don't have enough faith in myself. Even though my prediction turned out to be correct. I could have increased my bags by 12% if I followed my gut. 

Any of you guys/girls successfully managing to time the markets? Or do you all just hold and try to buy the dips? Anyone have some thoughts on IoTeX?  I'm a big fan of the IoT and where it can take our society, especially if it leverages blockchain.  IoTeX seems to be the leader in blockchain IoT technology and I feel they have some promise.  From a crypto standpoint though, does anyone have personal opinions on it? Is Loopring talk allowed here? [removed] Bullish weekend. Excited about the move on my portfolio.

Keeping the sub open should've been critical. Luckily there is r/Terra_Luna_crypto Major crisis event?  This is its death throes. First rug pull huh? Shameless mod behavior. 

The community created a new subreddit away from the tyranny of those mods. I noticed months ago that my comments were being taken down for no reason except stating my opinions.  Reddit is going to shit or I just started realizing that if the topic isn‚Äôt what Reddit wants discussed, that Reddit will just shut it down. Bro it's dead. I think it‚Äôs mostly because of suicide posts but I could be wrong. People continuing to push that crap as if it is worth more than üí© Not sure if you saw what was on the sub before it shut down but it was a mess.  Trolls in full force mixed with desperate people some on the edge of breaking.  It was a toxic brew. Yea let's show them by buying more I warned everyone about the crash on Saturday morning as UST was unpegging before LUNA completely unraveled. Then again on Sunday morning.

I was subsequently banned from the forum and shockingly we all saw the disaster that ensued. Lame. Doesn‚Äôt seem like the mods are genuine users- don‚Äôt have a lot of active posts- at least nothing in 2022, checked the twitter feed of crypto_cop- just Luna memes and retweets related to terra‚Ä¶buncha puppets maybe. They pulled a Robinhood Is Maddog running this sub?? The trolls If only there was a way to have  a decentralised platform, that couldn't be moderated... It's scary, yea, there's shitty fucking people, and shit you won't agree with. But that is a good example of why it's needed. Not locked for me and I am not a member. Honestly it's fucked on both sides. The sub shouldn't be shut down or locked without explanation.

But then that sub was spiraling into a crazy space where people were telling people to buy the dip.

It was basically a sub full of people losing grip with reality. But the dip or Terra 2.0 with 90% of the supply pre released. Reddit mods shouldn't have the power to ban users or lock subs without consensus. That‚Äôs why r/LunaTerra exists duh I know right, now that so many wish to voice their sorrows.

Its technique to deal with the decentralized problem is great.

DOT is another good project that has been around for a while and has big goals for the future. It is definitely one to buy and hold.",154,66,False," Polkadot [pros](/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v3ygx7/polkadot_is_going_to_enable_so_much_for_the_next/ib14af1/) & [cons](/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v3ygx7/polkadot_is_going_to_enable_so_much_for_the_next/ib14atn/) and related info are in the collapsed comments below. Pros and cons will change for every new post. The polkadot ecosystem is insane because it enables L1 interoperability. I don't think people understand the power of that. I love Polkadot and its ecosystem, but I'm not sure why DOT isn't utilized for gas or what the utility of DOT is other than to secure a parachain and the network. I'll look into it more thoroughly myself. Hello all,

I've dabbled in the top 30 cryptocurrencies, and by far Polkadot is the most promising. As you know, the DeFi market is just starting to emerge. I'm not sure how long it will take for institutions and businesses to incorporate Blockchain technology and defi products, certainly once regulation sets in. In fact, it has been happening now with GameStop, Chipotle, and FIFA etc.

However, currently the market is filled with rugpulls, bad fundamentals, and packs security and interoperability. Polkadot aims to solve both security and interoperability, and unlike Cosmos DOT has a more important function. Polka dots algorithm sets the rate of inflation and rewards, and everyone who holds DOT gets a say on the network, and even projects through crowdloans.

Currently most layer ones don't have a layer 0 that provides both security and interoperability, leaving many projects to either be hacked or exploited through bridges. Take advantage of being early, and focus on what will create a decentralized sector of business. Processing speeds do no matter right now, as NFTs are only being used for I'll purposes. These NFT's instead of being digital art, can be used for storing private information for businesses, and provide security through a Blockchain: which is what Polkadot provides and diminishes the possibility of error in security and interoperability. Once parathreads get released, businesses can license a slot for themselves, keeping information stored etc. 

NFT gaming can also start within the ecosystem, if a project gets enough DOT for a crowdloan then they will have enough demand from DOT holders who funded the project and received DOT rewards as well as the projects native token. An inflation rate helps encourage DOT holders to participate in the ecosystem, and stakers help secure the ecosystem.

I must say, after trying many different staking systems of various projects, ADA, AVAX, SOL, LUNA, and even COSMOS. Staking on Polkadot.js may be more technical, but provides compounding interest, and a clear information of what your asset is doing. To add to the fact, staking cycles through different nominators consistently: allowing for further decentralization between validators.

As a cherry on top, Gavin Wood was a former CTO of Ethereum. He developed Solidity, the Ethereum EVM, and the yellow paper of Ethereum. He was an important member to Ethereums success, and is overlooked compared to Vitalik Buterin: who I respect just as much as Gavin Wood. Personally, I hold both Ethereum and DOT as I don't believe in crypto maximalism, and believe they will both help evolve the space entirely.

The thing with crowdloans is the only risk you put in is the risk of opportunity through staking, typically a lock up for a project is 2 years. But with high risk comes high rewards, and if you make the correct choices you will end up with more than what you would have gotten if you had only staked. You can never lose your DOT in a crowdloan.

DOT is undervalued, and projects are being auctioned for a parachain slot as we speak! Once further development comes to these wonderful projects, we will see the power of the community of Polkadot. 

The system is entirely genius, and is one of a kind. It is both impressive tech, and will come to be an excellent investment. If you want to invest into the future, invest into Polkadot where amazing projects in the future will be built up on, and handled through the community. Ikr, will be supporting polkadot all the way. Just stake and forget about it Dot is definitely a good buy right now, right now It's so undervalued. It reminds me of other projects that can boom also, like Helium for example and CCD that can go 10x in the future. So many discounts, but so little money left in my wallet **:(** I was invested in polkadot for almost 2 years, but just late last year I started looking deeper into it's ecosystem including Kusama! The crowdloand system for parachains leases are great and an amazing hunting ground for gems, but even among high level of competitiveness there is a great deal of partnerships done on the space! One great example is how Unique Network and Equilibrium, which were battling at the same time for a parachain on Polkadot (both won a slot) are partnered now! I really can't understand Polkadot's price right now. It looks a huge bargain! The network is growing strong with quality parachains. Smart contracts (Astar Network, Moonbeam), DeFi (Acala Network, Equilibrium), NFT Chain (Unique Network), Infrastructure (Polkadot). It's getting bigger every year. A lot of development is on going on dot and I'm loving it. I'm particularly keeping my eyes locked on Unique Networks' launch on the polkadot ecosystem this weekend. I think it's going to be a big deal as the community is already all hyped up about this.

I'm holding DOT long-term tho. Big dick investors buy DOT. I've never seen a blockchain game that employs DOT. It‚Äôs as dead as the rest. I'm betting on Cosmos to be the next wave among new projects. No one needs to win Parachain auction before deploying on Cosmos and there are a number of top projects like OSMO, JUNO, NGM, CRE, SCRT already built on it. That‚Äôs why I cannot understand how Polkadot can still be so undervalued right now. I make sure to buy DOT and BTC every month I just want to say that it is still a work in progress and has a lot to prove. IMHO, DOT is my best hold. Love the team, love the tech, and the ecosystem is growing at a nice pace, Love everything about it. Indeed so. I recently learned about the upcoming Equilibrium launch, and the platform seems so comprehensive, being better than even AAVE as far as collateral requirements for loans go. Polkadot is yet to shine, and could be one of the surviving chains in the worst case scenario Love to see this. It seems like most coins these days focus on low transaction charges and neglect security. Part of the reason i roll with CCD, I'd be watching out to see how these changes are implemented on polkadot The potentials that lies with Polkadot is quite substantial. That's why I am essentially confident in Railgun's decision to deploy its privacy smart contract on the chain. In general, the ecosystem is very promising and might as well turn out to be one of the top 5 in the next couple of months. I got to understand Polkadot better through my interactions with Equilibrium, another project that won a slot in the auctions that happened few months ago. Super excited about the direction Polkadot is tilting towards",0.9997
3,Everyone is discussing what blockchain is going to rise. I‚Äôll tell you why I honestly think it‚Äôs Polygon.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/sq57tk/everyone_is_discussing_what_blockchain_is_going/,"I am an investor guys so I never focus on one main project. My wallet is proportionally diversified between altcoins and I have more than one eye-catching project. But I have always said that I highly value innovation and technology and has a lot of appreciation to dedication and hardwork. Thus, I will be focusing on the technological part as Polygon‚Äôs team is everything mentioned above. But I should mention that the project was one of the top gainers in 2021 cause that‚Äôs a fact.

Anyways Polygon so far has proved to be the best in the role it‚Äôs playing. In 2021 it had a lot of advancements and became the hero to address the core issues associated with Ethereum which are high gas fees, congestion, and lack of efficiency and scalability. Other than that, the ability to connect multiple channels and networks with one another was something new at the time and could be seen as the technology that solves the blockchain scalability problem entirely!

I won‚Äôt go into specific details because it will take a lot of time and writing, but to be honest, every record shows potential for consistent growth and upward trend for MATIC and that‚Äôs why I believe that it has a bright future especially with increased adoption, development, and involvement in every aspect of what is known as cryptoverse in the short and long term whether its NFTs, gaming, dApps, Defi, Metaverse, marketplaces..",12,14,False," And someone will tell you dot 
And another member will say solana 
Etc

And everyone is convinced and honest .... What do you mean by ‚Äúmultiple channels and networks‚Äù? >I won‚Äôt go into specific details 

you should, otherwise you are just talking your own book When I totally agree that the ridiculous fees of Polygon make it really an amazing project, I must confess that I disagree with the scalability aspect. I have seen Polygon getting highly congested and this has already made me lose thousands of dollars. You are essentially trying to swap a coin for another, and the transaction isn't going through, and there isn't much you can do about it. Even increasing gwei doesn't solve the situation sometimes.

And I saw that happening in June 2021 when there was even less people in DeFi. So it's good to have a low fee blockchain but when it cannot get your transaction through when you most need it, it's not so good anymore is it ? MATIC is key. Will it always be key? No. Eventually it will be replaced by a better product but for now its diamond. ETH is the king for sure! And all the projects that surround it just have to gain, and ETH has to gain with them! Either L2 like MATIC or LRC, crosschain like Polkadot or Unique Network, or integration like ICP! 
im confident that MATIC will be the leading ecosystem in DeFi, since its bringing countless developers into blockchain, and paving the way for Web3 developers to join the internet revolution Yeah.... It's down 12% today. That didn't go so well. I think QANplatform blockchain will rise, because its the first Quantum resistant layer 1 hybrid blockchain that is also compatible with ETH, its allows Devs to code on it in any programming language and it also uses the PoR algorithm which allows mobile phone validation once mainnet launches. relentless! Look into ‚Äúaleph zero‚Äù Polygon has actually done a great job in becoming a very good Ethereum subtitute for NFT blockchain, but it is not alone in this endeavour as Solana and Polkadot have also come a long way too.

The launch of parachain has even even further cemented Polkadots position in this group, as we'll begin to see scalable blockchains for NFTs with advanced features, like Unique Network launch soon.",0.9966

3,Where‚Äôs Everyone Staking Their Crypto for Max Rewards?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v1teew/wheres_everyone_staking_their_crypto_for_max/,"Hey everyone, sorry if this has been discussed already, but I‚Äôve been staking with CDC for as long as I can remember, I'm not an active investor in Crypto and I prefer to stake it in exchanges that make a decent APY (Not protocols). Initially, I was staking USDC and received around 12% APR, as my 3-month term comes to an end, it will change to 6%.

I‚Äôve been looking around for other exchanges to safely move my money into. Regarding high APYs, I know [NAGAX](https://invezz.com/news/2022/05/26/nagax-a-crypto-trading-platform-rolls-out-multi-coin-staking-feature/) recently launched their staking service with NGC, [Nexo](https://twitter.com/Nexo) still has high rates, and Celsius has decent percentages.

Just wondering where everyone‚Äôs been parking their money since the CDC incident. Let me know!",82,52,False," Have you heard about Anchor?  Yields 20% on your UST stable coins and it‚Äôs totally safe! Not mine, but I had seen this sheet shared on a previous similar post:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/htmlview In staking NGM on Kepler Chrome extension, APY is 23%.

GREEN on Greenhouse Dex for 30% APR.

PSDN on H2O Data app for 114% APR.

Next month OCEAN will release their single-sided staking program and I will jump on it too. Staking ATOM: 17%, JUNO: 104%, NGM: 23%, OSMO: 65%, SCRT:27% using Keplr browser extension

Staking GREEN on GreenHouseDex 28.89% APR Depends, if you want higher than like 10% you may have to go with a protocol, I'm still using CDC.. You could look into Bybits earn platform, they have a bunch of options. If you like high USDC rates, Voyager is still offering 9%. No lockups or anything like that, just maintain a monthly minimum balance. Their debit card is coming out now and only allows USDC spend, so it lets you save & spend a stablecoin, which is pretty simple. I use RocketPool and im happy with it..Now seems i will even stake my NFT for THOL ,for the first time..got into AngelBlock yesterday, thought it wont go up so dayum fast..minting cost 0.069ETH and some NFTs are sold now for over 10ETH per piece..rarity is best and being early, hope im in luck with the second mint also , thats coming up soon i hope..ppl seem to like their plans in the whitepaper Beefy Finance seems pretty good, although takes a bit more work to set up because it's DeFi.

It uses liquidity pools/pairs mainly, and supports several blockchains.

There are some decent rates, and you can do safer pairs like BTC or ETH to USDC. There are also riskier options at higher rates, but probably buyer beware for those. Not sure you've heard about Spool. It's quite understandable the potential reasons why you may not trust protocols. But what do you think about a protocol that is built by aggregating the top yield generators in such a way that the risks you are concerned about are spread out? I just checked again. There is a middle ware where USDC staking is running at 10% currently and that's what I'm familiar with. Critically assessed the risk models for a long time and I can categorically say that it's worth it, even those it may be lesser than the 12% you were making. I have Rowan staked on Keplr, CTSI staked on Binance. 180% & 40% APR respectively Mostly in stables and waiting to pick up FLD when it hits the market. Doing more staking on Keplr Wallet with ATOM, ROWAN, JUNO, SCRT, OSMO, EVMOS. Recently started staking CTSI on Binance.

The returns are decent for each of these assets. Well I'm using CDC as well and the returns are getting more and more shy! I'm looking for alternatives and DAFI looked interesting but complex as it has synthetic derivatives that would reward you with dtokens. A lot to go down this rabbit hole! I was staking with CDC also, bro. Now I have USDC on Yield, EURx/GBPx on Nexo and I'm staking DAFI on Dafi Protocol. I also have some altcoins like DOT and CAKE on locked staking (120d+) for better rewards. It's on DAFI for me. I get up to 250% plus staking on DAFI protocol. I understand that it's a bear market and prices drop and so do APYs. DAFI got a rewarding system that rewards you more especially for staking long term and through bear times. I prefer POS staking now, most of what I got staked are long term holds (I know I know, holding through a bear marketüò©), but I decided to do a bit of every strategy. 

So I'm mostly staking on the cosmos ecosystem through Keplr wallet, APR differs but very reasonable, SCRT 15%, ATOM 11%, ROWAN 184%, NGM 23% (this by far is the most stable price wise, proud of it).  
I still got other L1 like ProtonXPR staked.

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",16,178,False," The amount of people posting SHIBA TARGET $1.00 scares me to be honest. No understanding of market cap and available supply. I worry for the joe schmo who will get on the ride with everything he's got only to be disappointed. To fellow SHIB holders, don't allow insane comments to go unchecked. Invested in safemoon instead of shib and am sitting at $200 instead of $43million.  Want to cry and have felt sick all week. 

Invested in Hoge and at least got 100% gains in one day at least. Decentraland exploded today MANA still going Happy new week everyone, feels good to see Bitcoin in the greens again. I expect alts to start seeing some good runs as well. I'm Bullish on SYLO and DOT, I think they look well positioned to have a good run. What is it that makes a cryptocurrency attractive enough to investors that we see more growth than other cryptos/tokens?

Is it specific useful attributes?  Like low cost of transactions or finite supply of tokens?

Or is a loyal culture/fan base more important because it could create a self fulfilling prophecy that snowballs into something great?

Something else entirely?

Feel free to point out attributes that specific coins have or had especially things we can identify that were true just before they took off. I want to invest a bit more into crypto, but I'm wondering if it's a good time. 

Does everyone think that things are going to take off any further over the course of Q4? Or should I wait for the next dip? someone convince me to buy 600 worth of their coin of choice, otherwise its going in Shiba Why did SHIB circulating supply jump to 590 trillion?

Would it take the same effort volume wise for a coin to go from .0001 to .001 as it would .0000001 to .000001?

3,crypto groups,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v9vjz4/crypto_groups/,"Is there any legit group (free or paid) which provides technical analysis ideas and entry signals? I'm part of some of those groups in telegram but they all seems to be scams and fakes because they don't have a community page and they delete their signals once they're wrong... I don't mind to pay if there's a legit group

What I want in a group:

- decent community size.
- decent website
- a community page where people we can discuss their performance 

Thanks",12,32,False," Signals don't work. If someone could accurately predict the direction of the markets they are not going to be selling it for $49 a month via discord because they would not need to. They would just use the knowledge to make money and keep it as secret as possible. There is no legit group. Stop looking for an easy way out and start learning to read the market yourself if you want to make money shuffling numbers on a computer. It's a lot of hard work, and you'll probably lose money the first 1-2 years. If that's not for you go look for some other hard work you can do and get paid for. As a 10 year veteran in the crypto space, the best advice I can give is, ""Don't try to trade. DCA and hold."" Usually anyone who offers you TA, trading advice, etc. for free is going to eat your lunch, probably because they're just looking to pump their token. 
You might get lucky and make a few good trades, but it's much harder in a bear market. Now is the time to slowly accumulate with funds you can afford and wait for the bulls to come home. anybody that says they provide ""signals"", you do not want any part of. Plenty of good TA groups out there but they are hard to find. Traders Reality, Jayson Casper, and ive never done Chart Champions but ive heard good stuff about their learning content from some legit top traders. Just heard the guy that runs it is a douche. 

Ultimately, you want to learn TA and be part of a good group w top traders that you can learn from. But I can tell you that it's going to take a while to learn. And that tons of new people join every day looking for ""signals"" and the top traders in those groups are annoyed as hell w the rotating done of people looking for signals. 

If you join a group, go in w a growth mindset, post ur TA and ideas, show ur doing the work, and if ur in a good group vets will see ur not someone looking for signals that will be gone next week and they might help. 

There is no quick path to the top. People who say DCA is the only way,  or people who say to have diamond hands are idiots. Diamond hands is exactly what market makers want retail traders to have so they can sell into strength. 

If you are a long term investor, DCA is legit. Just invest a set amount every period u decide and totally forget about it. Diamond Hands is for morons

Becoming consistently profitable as a trader is hard as hell. This is an arena filled w the smartest people in the world. if it was easy, everyone would do it. And you will probably get REKT in the beginning. I did. And all of the top traders I know started their journey by getting REKT. I'm not a top trader. I'm not particularly smart. But w a lot of work I've become profitable. You just gotta have the desire to do the work to learn. just do copy trading from your favorite investor.
or join the alt coin group you invested in for any updates

entry signals arent accurate and most TA groups wont genuinely help you invest unless you join a rugpull group There is one called ‚Äúblue whale‚Äù I follow on fb and discord. He does provide signals with entry and exits. I‚Äôve been eyeing it for a while. He gives out some free signals to all and seems to be mostly
Spot on All of them can do TA, but then when you see them complaining about their laptop you know they don‚Äôt really do well with those TA üòù Want a strategy For futures trading? There is a proverb in Turkish, you can't make sex with someone else's dick.

Learn TA and make your own setups. Now should be the best time to buy and hold Bitcoin because it will soon come up to a standard rate which enough profits will be granted. I'm an app designer, if you want to Collab on creating something send a plan There's a TA tab in the r/cc discord. Check out chart champions, you Will learn to make TA yourself, everything from identifying support and resistance points, learn to read the order book (exocharts) through their custom templates, scalping strategies, cyphers, overall market structure. And their discord has an amazing crew. They do not provide signals, but everyone is sharing ideas All the time.

I‚Äôm looking for an exchange that has a decent iOS app. I‚Äôm shocked that Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, & Coinbase Pro does not show profit & loss on your portfolio. I‚Äôm surprised more people aren‚Äôt demanding this. It feels Ike they are setting us up to fail by using such basic info. I travel a lot so I‚Äôm barely at a desktop.

I want to be able to see my portfolio breakdown and see each crypto‚Äôs P&L, price, percentage change, value, quantity, value, average cost, etc.

The only exchange that I have found to do this all is Voyager, however it doesn‚Äôt integrate with Mint. That is my other requirement, it needs to be one of the exchanges that Mint is using: 
Binance BitMart Bitstamp Bittrex BlockFi Celsius Coinbase Coinbase Pro Coinzoom GEMINI Kucoin Kraken Paypal Robinhood Uphold

A bonus would be low fees as well. Is there a place that compares up to date fees on all exchanges? So, should I hold Bitcoin for longer or sell now? Anyone have some predictions? üòÖüòè",0.9917

3,"Web3 is a topic that is being discussed lately and I am interested in the safest web3 wallet available, is there any?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/roi82u/web3_is_a_topic_that_is_being_discussed_lately/,"Is Web3 the Internet of the future, or is it just a fad? The recent feud about web3 caught my attention and I felt like sharing my thoughts. Recently, Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk stated that Web3 is a ruse and that it is inferior to Web2.

You've probably heard the terms ""Web 2.0"" and ""Web 3.0"" a lot in the blockchain world. 
Web 1.0 was the first ""phase"" of the internet and Web pages were static , while Web 2.0 is the internet as we know it today and it is all about engagement. And if Facebook crashes tomorrow, all information, businesses, connections, and lives built around the use of its platform would be lost. But, People in a Web3 world control their own data and use a single personalized account to go from social media to email to shopping.

Web3 characteristics:

Verifiable
Trustless
Self-governing
Permissionless

But, before you can enter the wide world of Web3 applications, you need to install a wallet application that is Web3 compatible, and web3 wallets are self-custodial. 

Examples of web3 wallet

MetaMask
Coinbase Wallet
Argent
Sylo
Crypto.com DeFi Wallet

 But Sylo seems to be different.from other wallets mentioned here and this is why.

I found out that Sylo is decentralized because it's built on the Sylo Network. And truly, this is how online communication should work. In addition, communications in Sylo are genuinely safe because it is combined with military-grade encryption.

The Sylo app is an instant messaging dApp and blockchain wallet, you can send and receive crypto like BTC, ETH and XTZ or NFTs like ERC20 and ERC71 in-app,and you can chat as if you were sending a Whatsapp message. I learnt it is also building an open and inclusive Web3 run by communities by providing an incentivised node network. 

Sylo is autonomous, p2p, e2ee, and run by the community for the community, without spying on them or harvesting their data, according to my findings. Other developers can use the Sylo SDK to create web3 Dapps for the Sylo Network. You can also do your own research, check their website https://www.sylo.io/

I'm currently using Metamask, but I just downloaded the Sylo smart wallet on Android, which is fine, and I feel ecstatic, but I'm interested in your opinion on web3 and wallets?

What is the safest web3 wallet?",8,22,False," This question was sponsored by Sylo. Sell your kidneys and get Sylo now. Sylo is a great project. I find it very amazing. 
Another web3 related project that i find amazing is DEIP. They‚Äôre tokenizing intangibles in the form of fractionalized NFTs. Sylo is great, I've been using it for a while now and it works great, I like the UI and also the added messaging feature is pretty cool. This is an interesting concept. Is SYLO's wallet using the same multi-signature technology as UnidoEP's? This raises the level of security significantly.",0.9868

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",18,154,False," What coin are y‚Äôall loading up on right now? Hedera Hashgraph HBAR, a revolutionary alternative to blockchain is up 826% YTD. Compared with blockchain, it‚Äôs quicker, cheaper, more secure and SEC compliant. Why do all the posts on many crypto currency subreddits seem so scammy? They don't even look like they're from real reddit users but are being spammed by bots with tons of emojis and sensational bullet points. The stock/investing/options subreddits aren't like this at all, wondering what's wrong with the crypto ones  So how many of you are into TA vs fundamentals? Sorry I'm new here (reddit, cryptocurrency, trading...) I've been trading crypto for a few months now and I've been frustrated by Coinbase's lack of portfolio management tools. It seems like there are some web-based services available that provide this capability, but they all require subscriptions and your portfolio's API keys -- a big red flag for me.  
So I chose to develop my own toolset in Python. I'm going to document my process on my Publish0x blog. I want to share it here because it seems like there's a real desire from amateur crypto enthusiasts like myself to take more control over their crypto portfolios. I hope it helps!

The git repository is already public but its very bare bones, so I'll share it later. Stay tuned for more posts on authenticating your API keys, plotting portfolio performance, etc. Any recommendations or critiques are appreciated. I hope everyone buys their $30 in btc tomorrow Why are all the prices dropping so much? I read an article on Blockster about how the recent level below $30K signals the end of the mini bear market and shows the strength to make a new all-time high in 2-4 months. The article is titled ""Prices Trending Upwards - Did Bitcoin Just Double Test The Bottom?"" Scenario: You found $100 on the street and it is absolutely BURNING to be used in your wallet. What would you dump it into without a second thought and why? Is Solana still gonna go? What do you guys think of FTM, I think its still undervalue. SpookySwap has the best UI of a any DEX ive used. Anyone have thoughts about $TKY altcoin? Good thing I sold all of my ICP in the low 60's two days ago to stock up on XTZ and DOT....I'm doing this right, right? Guys who love Staking I found an article on Blockster about the top three cryptocurrency wallets that support Staking. The article is called ""Top Three Crypto Wallets That Support Staking"". Hi everyone, I just bought a bit of e.cash (XEC). I am thinking about to put in more, but I wanted to see what is your opinion. The team and tech looks solid, but I am no expert in this. So, what are your opinions about XEC? https://www.google.ca/amp/s/fortune.com/2021/09/06/meme-crypto-social-media-pumps-bitcoin-el-salvador-legal-currency/amp/ $PBTS Eth mining efficiency increases by 15%, that‚Äôll generate good profit for them Tixl always have something new and exciting to share. GamyFi, the #blockchain based #ESports and #gaming platform, is now supported on cross-chain bridge. This gives $GFX holders the ability to safely act cross-chain using Tixl's Cross-Chain. And how do DEX exchanges differ from traditional centralized exchanges? How do decentralized exchanges (DEX) work in general? I read an article on this topic on Blockster, it's called that, but it would be interesting to hear other people's options, so let's discuss! Since moon is too full of people lately, get yourselfs comfortable cause we are going to center of earth now XD  (imagine here some rockets emojis going down) Do you think it‚Äôs a good time to buy SXP? opinion on xrp and btc? [removed] [removed] I think CMC is drunk. Stellar down 98% according to them. I read an article on Blockster that financial NFT is a relatively new term, known only to a few people in the blockchain industry. The term is an extended application of non-functional tokens (NFTs), I recently read an article about it. So I guess it's all ahead of the curve. Hello I think Music NFT platforms are definitely the next big thing, an early stage start up I came across is Amplify Art check it out!

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",16,113,False," [removed] Thinking about swapping my Link to Matic for staking during the dip Looks like the back end of September is going to be rough, hopefully October and November will be booming. [deleted] [removed] Hedera Hashgraph HBAR up 1000% YTD, compared with Bitcoin‚Äôs BTC 30% YTD increase. Why? Because Hashgraph is a superior platform to anything built on blockchain. It‚Äôs cheaper, quicker, more secure, consumes less energy and is SEC compliant. Hi everybody,
I would like to invest in crypto.  
Which cryptos would you all recommend?   Which ones are likely to be the next big thing ? 

I‚Äôm new and definitely feel like I missed out on earlier ones.  

Thanks project is very good project. I really like this project. Because this project manager is very honest. I hope this project was successful.This project will positively change the crypto world for the better. [removed] After some research and study I've compiled a list of 18 cryptocurrencies available on Coinbase Pro that I think have the opportunity to collectively generate great returns with Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA). I simulated the 18-coin fund's performance between Jan 1. 2021 and mid September and the results are very promising.

Figured I'd share for community awareness and feedback. I'm very interested in the concept of large cap crypto funds and DCA applied to cryptocurrencies, but the resources and commentary online for these topics is surprisingly sparse. Definitely comment or reach out if you have experience -- I'm pretty data starved on the subject at this moment, so any feedback would be very appreciated.  
Cheers and good luck with your moves for the new week! [removed] Greetings. I'll try to resubmit my question here, since I'm basically a guest.  
  
A colleague recommended me a trading site for the coins which is ""better than Binance"", but I had a negative experience with scam and the sites which would disappear suddenly. Are there any hints how to detect suspicious ones?  
  
I'm worried each time I see something from Hong Kong and if it requires an ""invitation code"".  
  
E.g. what about this one - Gsailex\[dot\]\[com\]?  
  
Thank's for the eventual help. I really want to invest as soon as possible but I‚Äôm not sure where I should invest. I can allocate 60k-70k pesos for investment. Torn between investing in BTC, ETH, ADA (all three or just one‚Äî not sure yet) OR Axie Infinity. If I push through with Axie, I will have to get a scholar. Which investment should I choose? is anyone here familiar with PLUGnet and their approach to synthetic assets? i saw that Yahoo Finance released the article about them today. i think it can be a big deal in the future. they basically don't have any competitors. [Some brief DD](https://shitlistcrypto.substack.com/p/defi-as-a-service-banker) on a newly listed project offering ""DeFi as a Service"" [removed] Does anybody know of a solid list showing all coin distributions?

I was looking up the richlist through bit info charts, and I was also watching Max Maher's video showing his Crypto Screener when choosing to buy a coin and I couldn't find any good sources to show who owns what percent of a certain coin. For reference, this is the snippt from the video where I learned about the bitinfo charts, but they only show the rich list for about 8 coins. Hi people, looking for some advice, im fairly new to crypto and so far have been investing solely in XRP. I want to diversify my portfolio and im looking to start investing in another crypto. I have done research but im still not sure, so far ive considered XLM, ADA, COSMOS and ALGORAND. I want to invest my money into a crypto that has genuine real world use and will still be around in 10-15 years. Any advice on what coin i should pick and why would be greatly appreciated, cheers. Any thoughts on Shiba being available on Coinbase? Is it worth a token investment? r/ethereumMax muting and banning Redditors for questioning shrill posts. I'm down 95%, questioned some blatant shrill and was booted. anyone available for tutoring? I am generally interested and know a decent amount about mining and am possibly looking to switch into this for a career but haven't started yet, I have someone who is interested in investing a good amount but I want to know the ins and outs first and know details before sinking that much of not my own money. just need someone who is operational I don't care what size but knows this industry well. thanks reddit How do you track your coins?

Hello everyone, 

I bought about 10 different coins a month ago, but I don't remember the purchase prices anymore. 

Now I want to buy more, but I don't know how to make the average price of the coins. 

Someone can help me? 

What do you use to control and know the price of coins in your portfolio? 

Thanks Any thoughts on the recent drop in Ethereum? Will the drop continue? The top 5 wallets in gaming coins (such as Illuvium, Axie Infinity & The Sandbox) hold over 75% of the total supply. Is it safe to invest in any of the top gaming currencies without being concerned of a rug pull? Or is it just the ""shadow behind us"" that we have to get used to?

What are your thoughts on that? Let's discuss, I will be interested to read your opinion What kind of mental gymnastics does it take to dream of paying fees for slow transactions. I have Ethereum users who saw their centralized miners override the protocol talking about how their fees are network security to prevent it from being changed? Where is the permanence.

With how afraid The world bank, the IMF, and the US government are of crypto as a whole I've begun to form a hypothesis that perhaps, instead of regulations, they might be the very ""whales"" constantly causing ""flash crashes"". It happens any time coins are on the rise consistently. It happened with the El Salvador adoption of Bitcoin. I am really beginning to believe that world governments are manipulating the prices to prevent large gains and further hype about crypto. After all, if the market is scary, less ppl will rally around it. Right? Anybody got experience with dollar cost averaging cryptocurrencies? I'm studying up on it and running some independent analysis on previous years, and the potential returns are quite attractive.

    info_comment: Your opinion about the current status of the Defi market? Do you think the potential Defi has been exploited, how to Oasis will how to turn DEFI into a better place, easy to use and accessible for everyone? We all know partnerships are important for a project to get started in the space, could you share more on what partners Oasis has and how it translates into actual activities? I mentioned the Oasis SDK which is a great chance for me to move into discussing our upcoming roadmap. Would you mind highlighting some of the upcoming events that you‚Äôre excited about? how important is the community for ROSE and what steps will be taken by team to keep interest of community & investors intact. are you gonna be the one that saves me? You organized an AMA session very rewarding and received a lot of questions related to utilities and technology, future vision, ...So now I want to ask what do you want to receive from the community? [deleted] Hey y‚Äôall, thanks for doing this! My question is: what exactly is the difference between Oasis Labs and the Oasis Foundation? And how are they related? Data tokenisation will surely have a huge part to play in the future of the economy. What makes Rose more capable than the rest of delivering this? No doubt privacy and DeFi are important to Oasis but the markets is becoming more demanding, can Oasis create and apply new forms of Gamification that will encourage more users to buy and hold the $ROSE token for longer? Is there a plan for this from the core team? Or is there already a ParaTime working on it? This would be good for $ROSE in the markets. Can you please us the motivation and benefits for traders/ investors to hold ROSE token in a long term investment. I'm so curious about your plans to help drive demand and scarcity for the token. Regarding marketing, what plans, ideas and next steps does your project have to attract investors and users? Do you intend to leverage the popularity of social media to make your Project even more popular? With all those future goals when it comes to the tokenomic structure of the project, we also want to know a bit more about the roadmap. What are the next big milestones for Oasis ? NFT and Marketing walk side by side in the crypto space and we know how important it is to create hype about collections. What are you guys planning and already executing on the marketing side? Any interesting promotions that our community should be aware of? For sure data tokenization is one of the big topics related with the value proposition behind Oasis. In the future, who wiil be the biggest beneficiaries of the proposed data tokenization ‚Äçand who will be the biggest losers as a result of the proposed tokenization approach?  
  
‚Äç P2E games are blowing up in the cryptocurrency space with great potential. A significant issue for many of the currently offered P2E games is just that they are being created as blockchain games, not great games where blockchain is just one element. How's ""ROSE "" different? I really liked the initiative from the team to develop an in-house ROSE wallet, however is something also being to have an in-house KYC / identification dApp? We currently use a third party for KYC verification. Also, with cobalt upgrade which introduces on chain governance function for community based growth, are there any works on DAO incentivization schedule, or any decision on how/which voting system will be implemented? The trend these days is obviously NFT gaming - especially the ones with Play-to-earn system. I see that it‚Äôs one strong point of ROSE. Can you explain more about Oasis‚Äôs Play-to-earn mechanism? How many team members do you have? Do they have enough experience in the blockchain field? Do they have any experience on working in crypto and non-crypto project? Oasis is partnered with other projects like chainlink and shyft. Can you elaborate on how you see these partnerships going. Like how does a shyft integration work? Does ROSE represent the game creation platform of the future? Why is it better to build games in the blockchain and not in the traditional way with centralized platforms? What kind of partnerships with different projects/platforms/protocols can we expect from Oasis in the future? Could you give us some examples of how other projects can leverage Oasis ? Can you point out a few great features of "" Oasis"" that will set it apart from other competitors? What competitive advantage of "" Oasis"" makes you confident you will outperform rival platforms? Regarding marketing, what plans, ideas and next steps does your project have to attract investors and users? Do you intend to leverage the popularity of social media to make your Project even more popular? So many projects just like to speak about the ""long term vision and mission"" but what are your short terms objectives? What are you focusing right now? On which types of Industries & user base ROSE project is mainly focusing on? Do you plan to establish partnerships with local cryptocurrency developers in each country to make the use of ROSE more global? an you elaborate on the distinction between TEEs as used in Oasis ParaTimes, and TEEs as used in DONs i.e. Chainlinks DECO/Town Crier? Play to earn is definitely hot at the moment! But there is still a gap between traditional gamers and blockchain gamers. How will you bridge this gap? What is you plan to expand the adoption of your project to the traditional gamer? Staking programme is very important for any project, Can i stake your token? Do you have any plan of starting staking programme? I am still learning all the new parts of Crypto and NFT's. I am just commenting because I am in some serious eviction problems because of mental health issues and $2000 would cover my back rent and give me much breathing room for the creation of my own NFT's and be able to participate properly. I am reading through all the comments now. If someone would invest $2k in ROSE, are there any projects on DEXes for us to transfer our funds, stake / LPs? Or a tutorial on how or what we should do? Why is oasis and rose id√©al for DeFi ? What are your plans for getting listed in certain exchanges? Thanks. I just want to participate for the prize. To prove to myself that I can actually win one of these things. How secure is Oasis, can you tell us more about this subject? Do you guys provide a Wonderwall for security reasons? ty for the ama! Damn I missed out. Was asleep on this side of the world. Rooting for $ROSE and glad I've invested into your project It seems you to me that mainstream crypto and web3 adoption wont happen untill the mainstreams finds great utility in these projects. So as an organization that focuses on crypto adoption, Defi, Dapps etc. How do you plan on bringing these projects to the mainstream? Love your team and I believe you are doing great work! I understand how privacy focused DeFi will become more and more relevant over time as the line between traditional and decentralized finance gets blurred. Besides this, I read that other sectors such as healthcare can leverage Oasis as well? Heck, even BMW is partnered with you guys. I always thought defi is about ‚Äúfinance‚Äù as the acronym suggests. How will $ROSE help improve security and privacy in sectors such as the industries mentioned above and more? What am I missing? 

Love the project nonetheless and I‚Äôm already staking via the official wallet. Keep up the amazing work! ü§© NFT space is growing, and there are so many exciting projects on Oasis already. What do you think about NFTs and reshaping the future of GameFi and NFT space in general? What is the difference between Oasis and others L1‚Äôs? I did my research on Oasis, and it looks promising. 

One thing I could not find is, where did Oasis name come from? Why ROSE as token name? Thanks for the opportunity to engage, the main question i have is the following: how specifically do you intend to address the fact that in a busy environment like the crypto space there seems to be so much focus on hype and marketing campaign which seems to drive non-organic growth of user vs more commitment towards real use-case scenarios? What's your main objective in terms of sustainable long-term commitment towards the users? [deleted] When did you realize you wanted to be a full time blockchain developer? What attracted you to the Oasis Network? Is Parcel going to be it‚Äôs own paratime or a layer 2? Will the Rose coin be used to fuel Parcel? How exactly is a partner like e.g. BMW Group using your technology? Thank you, love what you are building! [deleted] In layman terms, what does the Damask update bring to the table? Regulation is very important, several projects in many countries were closed due to a lack of necessary licencing. How do you deal with this problem? Are you working on a project that complies with regulations? Do the token holders have the right to participate in the governance of the project? What kind of decisions can they vote on about the project? Almost 4/5 of investors are focused purely on the price of token in short term instead of understanding the real value and health of the project. Could you tell us on motivations and benefits for investors to hold your token in long term? Until what corner of the world do you plan to arrive? that is, to what extent in the world do you think your Project will be solving people's problems with their infrastructure? On which DEX platforms can I buy your token and are you planning to list on new exchanges? I seen that you have done many AMAs, my question is, what do you expect to get from so many AMAs and what are your goals with the community? Do you consider the community to be a fundamental role in the project? How does project increase the token's value, liquidity and utility ? So that it can lead to an increase in token prices ? What is your plan to make your project stable and provide the highest return for investors in the long term ? Partnerships and cooperation are important for project improvement and development. Can you tell us about your current partners? Will this partnership benefit Your project and users? Has anyone asked the ... when Meta update question yet? Good to see you guys @oasis here. Way to go ! Hey Oasis team, thanks for this AMA. Unfortunately too late to ask questions myself, but I've been curious about the chain so it's great to get some insights from the team. Kinda Late , but What is the difference between what kilt and OasisProtocol
 offers? I understand parachain and paratimes as the tech but what about use cases? You are not Oasis. Liam and Noel are Oasis. What‚Äôs your plan of attack for marketing?

How does this impact the performance of the $ROSE token and the future of the platform overall? [deleted] How does this compare to Cardano or what would you say is better in comparison to Cardano? It is very interesting that Oasis Protocol is built modular to the point consensus mechanisms are easily altered.

Are there any current efforts in the Lab to determine what consensus is best for data security within Oasis? Or is that a challenge that will be tackled years down the road? It is well known that proof-of-stake sacrifices security for throughput.

Thank you! Loving our Emerald paratime. Hi! Your project seems very promising! Do you have a roadmap for metaverse engagement? Seems like your other use cases are pretty well developed and I'd like to learn more. Also, any plans to partner with US-based exchanges for the ROSE token? Sounds like a sweet giveaway! So my question is how will you guys be able to scale your layer 1 networks, where bigger blockchains like bitcoin, ethereum and other blockchains have been struggling to process transactions in times of increased demand. 
Thanks How private are transactions and smart contract interactions on your networks? What information can be seen on a block explorer? Is oasis DARPA? The best tech in the world still goes nowhere without adoption. What steps are Oasis taking to stand out from the crowd of other L1's? wow, is here one real account present? [removed] can the oasis add more backers and more influential people or investors to make the ecosystem more attractive to people? 

snoopdog elon buffet noel gallagher \^\_\^ joe biden? Do you think that having a giveaway reward for asking questions led to a lot more terrible questions being asked? You are certainly not the leader in L1 DeFi blockchains, have you guys heard of Ethereum? What makes you think you can make such bold claims and not loose all credibility? Can't loose what you don't have i guess. Name dropping a few partners doesn‚Äòt make a difference either. Interesting that you even think this matters, says everything about your approach.",0.9999

3,What? You guys haven‚Äôt discussed IOTA yet?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/phzpva/what_you_guys_havent_discussed_iota_yet/,"There is a big shortsqueeze going on that you should not miss out. Oh, and the coin is fee less and worth to be watchlisted anyway‚Ä¶",66,59,False," 

For those who dont know about $IOTA I seriously reccomend having a look on the IOTA website, https://www.iota.org/ There is some impressive projects lined up for example,

Iota mobility...the usage of car wallets, smart charging and usage based insurance. (This really excites me, the possibilities for this is huge,) Jaguar, Land Rover have already implemented an IOTA wallet into their I-pace vehicles enabling them to recieve payments for selling data aswell as make things for payments like parking and tolls.

*Smart Cities...Urban mobility management, peer to peer collaboration with open and transparent data.

*Global trade...Track and trace (stupidly important right now,) customs and border management.

*Social impact...Sustainalbility, identity, 

Iota also has over 100 partnerships with the likes of, Land Rover Jaguar and Dell.

Not to mention the very real possibility of a short squeeze right now, this project is seriously undervalued

The ""tangle"" is completely different than most blockchain projects and I couldn't be more excited to see this projects future, Look into it I think you'll be impressed. I sold mine one day before it began to rise and stuck my money into a shit coin, I'm down 50% when I could have been up 100% Tell us more. Popped up on the radar recently? Facts no one talks about it I've been trying to tell ya'll for months now. Even posting in this sub... 

Just download firefly and buy like $5 iota and withdraw it or ask a someone to send you some. You will buy more when you see how fast and seamless it is. I promise. Still waiting for it to rocket... Seems a bit slower than the other coins in my portfolio. Sorry to be the noob here but can someone define a shortsqueeze and why/how it will affect the market? Excitement around a coin shouldn‚Äôt come from its market performance. It should only come from the actual utility and uniqueness of the coin itself. What does iota do, and why is it going to continue to grow, in your opinion? Bro when the MF coin was less than a dolar nobody said sh* aaaa but now everybody wants to pump they bags... I haven‚Äôt heard anyone talk about iota for years. im in already, great project Lmao @ ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù

What a fool Ahh...you must be newish here. 
 

IOTA with Shilled to death on this sub, it simply leaves a bad taste in most people's mouths who'd been here for a few year. 


IOTA was pumped way up, and a lot of people got Wrecked in the 2018-2019 crash. Iota is garbage, that‚Äôs why

Enough people have been rekt with it

Dump your bags and move on So the shorts had gone up to 200% 3 Days agi. as of last night it was down to 169%. Don't know where the baseline is.

Edit: i dont understand how this would work. I have only traded on binance but when shorting something I have used futures. There might be a another way. Futures are placed with USDT not with the token. 
When shorting something in crypto do you borrow the asset or is it placed in stablecoins? [removed] Next short squeeze is BSV. The most shorted crypto. Pump will be nice. Coordinated from Korean. Already traded 30% higher on Korean exchange then the rest. Will be a nice pump for sure üòÄ Token not needed amirite? Iota must be one of the most pathetic projects and communities out there. To get some truth about iota you should follow this guy on twitter and ignore OP

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",16,187,False," US govt (and others) are trying to strangle crypto to maintain monetary fiat control. I don‚Äôt think it will work long or even medium-term.

Think big, only invest what you can afford to lose for now and remember this is exactly why crypto was created in the first place: to wrest control from govt and big finance and cede it to the people.

This dip won‚Äôt be forever, but it can last longer than everyone is comfortable with. Don‚Äôt panic sell now if you can afford to stay in the game! Good luck all- let‚Äôs take the power back! [removed] [removed] Hi i am new in crypto, like 2 Months in. 
And I was wondering because the market is like it is. I have only one crypto coin that i am in the green with like 53% since June.06.2021 and its Bao finance 
....All the others are RED. üòÖ 

I don't hear about it in the sub reddits only BTC,ETH,DOGE etc. 

Do others like me have bao finance? [removed] Can someone explain to me the purpose of alt coins? for example, I understand the purpose of the uniswap website, pancake swap, balancer, compound etc... But I don't understand why their tokens have value because their tokens don't really have any use so why are people investing in them? [deleted] [removed] The market was red like this last summer so this is nothing new to me better prepare for the summer next year I need karma thank you Well I just had about seven thoughtful posts to the main sub removed because I am a few karma short.

[removed] [removed] * I have like $37.5k invested total in bitcoin, and after the crash, I only have $10.8k gains. If I sold at $65k, I'd have $100k right now in cash.  

* I basically bought a whole coin at around $10k, held since, gained a lot, bought more to have .5 more buying on the way up from $35-60k. My new stack got cut in half. So basically it equalized and what would have been $100k if we kept going up is now around $50k.  

* I'm down a lot right now from my new stack. Should I just hodl, or sell expecting it to dip to $27k and to buy back in and have more bitcoin? Or could bitcoin surprise us, break the resistance line, go past $32.8k? Seems like $30k has been support since February.  

* If I sold my btc at $48,558, and bought back in at $27k, I could have .2 more btc. If I bought back in at $25, I could have 2 whole coins. Idk what to dooo. I don't wanna hold and then be even more negative, and I'm scared if I sell, it could go back up.  

* I don't wanna sell, and then wake up to find bitcoin is going back up and I end up with less bitcoin, and less fiat.  

* If I sold, I wouldn't have to pay big capital gains tax (my salary is $89k) either right since my gains has came down to 10.5k instead of selling at $65k with those gains?  

* What could happen to bitcoin at the end of the month, some people are thinking $27k, because of the resistance and support lines meeting (descending wedge).. or we can hope and hope tons of buying volume to break resistance back to a bull run.

After a few weeks of run-n-gun crypto trading I decided to finally add some intelligence to my tactics. I started with Coinbase Pro in May, but unfortunately CbPro only shows users their current portfolio value and doesn't offer any management or tracking tools like a typical brockerage's online GUI would. From what I can tell, most Coinbase users subscribe to online portfolio managers to track their returns, generate charts, etc.  
This is a sensible move -- but I'm too stubborn and too curious for my own good. I decided to save money and learn a bit by spending absolutely way too much time learning about web API's and Coinbase Pro's API in particular. I'm now developing my own crypto portfolio management software in Python.  
First thing I wanted to do is understand how the overall portfolio has performed. The most straightforward way I could think of was to divide the total portfolio value in USD per day since inception by the total amount of USD deposits made until then. This gives a simple ratio, where values greater than one mean the portfolio is worth more than the deposits, and values less than one mean the portfolio is worth less. Behold the fruits of my keyboard labor (the image I tried to attach -- I'm new to Reddit posting too, so bear with me please).  
https://imgur.com/VRbZnta  
The result paints a pretty dismal picture of my trading. My portfolio value has been in the red since the start of June and dipped as low as \~65 percent of my deposits. As of yesterday I've been sitting at about 80 percent.  
Anyways, developing this tool has me pretty excited and I wanted to share my start with y'all. If anyone has recommendations for free (or cheap!) crypto portfolio management software that offers tools a normal brokerage would, I'm all ears -- same goes for recommended analyses, charts, etc that I should tackle next.

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",20,160,False," Bitcoin 29000$: Yeah, dont wanna buy yet.

Bitcoin 390000$: Yeah boys, buy buy we are going to moon [removed] [removed] Any ideas how long this time the market will be up and running? Do you use a wallet and exchange or both and why? Personally, i use a wallet for all the cryptos on available on an exchange... HBAR is raising the bar. When Bitcoin goes high the alt coins will follow the same? I see when bit coin down all other alt coins are followed Hello there, I was wondering if you use stop-loss, and with that, do you take profits manually or do you have a set target and it automatically triggers at that price? I cant seem to find the latter anywhere. (unlike stop loss which triggers automatically) Our German and very well known business newspaper ""Handelsblatt"" has just published an article titled: ""Special funds are allowed to invest up to 20 percent in crypto"" and subtitled: ""A new law allows institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin and Co. Private investors will be able to invest indirectly via the online broker of the savings banks in the future."" Here is the link: https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/maerkte/devisen-rohstoffe/bitcoin-ether-und-co-spezialfonds-duerfen-bis-zu-20-prozent-in-krypto-werte-investieren/27469878.html https://youtu.be/GpvCp2vxpXk

Encourage everyone to check out this video , it‚Äôs on a hidden gem called MultiVAC (mtv) Karma Pls Bitcoin is probably in its final downtrend. I don't like cryptos but anticipated the short of 65k at 29k, so I am dealing with bitcoin. Now we are in the final distribution phase and should see another halving of the price for this. That means higher levels in the short term. Currently, I have correctly anticipated the move from 33k to 39.5k and there should now be a retracement to 33/34k. From here, bitcoin should rise to around 50k. This level results from the possibility of completing the second sell-off to the breakout line 20-22k with a move of <50%. Therefore, 50k should be watched, because from there bitcoin could fall to 20-22 / at least 25k. Here, one could then cautiously build a medium- to long-term position. In summary, it is very likely that the sequence will be similar: Superior: 65k to 20/25k Subordinate: 65k to 30k to 39/40k to 33/34k to 48/51k to 20/22-25k. Then the move is completely worked off and also a lot of leverage is worked off in bitcoin that was on the wrong side. Here we need to see if bitcoin positions are built up. is there anyone here who sees it similarly? Any thoughts on Radix being a serious competitor to HBAR? Lol. Market going up again, my long on SynFutures going well, could have been liquidated but this protocol is life saver. 50500 and 2900 before dumping hard classic 0.618 bear market action XLM fans,  The SDEX now has a site like CMC but for Stellar.

Do have a look and upvote if you like the tool. How do you feel about your fiat job? what do you think. will bitcoin be able to sustainably overcome 41k today or will we see a pullback? and if a pullback comes, where do you estimate it will hold? I think 40k is a huge resistance and we will go back to 33k levels to tank again. For all new coins , send me a DM and I will do a deep dive and video into your coin and it‚Äôs strengths and opportunities What are our thoughts on the rest of this week?

https://denizdozer.medium.com/ What are the best coins to invest in now? What is the best Crypto Exchange for USA?

I do not know why I am stressing out about this so much. I have been on coin base for maybe two months now, and I just realized they are almost the most expensive for anything lol. 
I would love to have Binance or KuCoin, but there are restrictions on US customers (I understand I can use a VPN), however I think KuCoin limits to like $2k activity a day or something like that. And a run around for that, is buying crypto and sending it to these platforms with many steps involved, and it seems more of a headache than it should be.
I am stuck looking at Kraken and am currently moving everything to CoinBase pro (cheaper). I was also interested in crypto.com but have read many negatives about them and how there servers go down when trading volume gets so high. 

However, looking at Kraken I am still a little uncertain on how their fees are set up, so if anyone is using that can you chime in on what the fees are for depositing or withdrawing from your bank or what the free option is. I hate to be that guy with FOMO, but watching things like SHIB rise 150% lol

&#x200B;

Its sure tempting lol Made some lose in doge.. looking for some crypto to day trade any suggestions in which i can make a short term profit Unfortunately the thread I originally posted this in was deleted but I'm way to proud of it to just let it die.

I'm sure you all know these futuristic sounding crypto projects that claim to change everything while saying absolutely nothing? You know the ones with fancy ass webdesign and 5 buzzwords in every second sentence?

I grew tired of them years ago and every time I see one of these pretentious world changers it's grinding my gears even more then the previous one. I swear they could as well be randomly generated at this point.

https://denizdozer.medium.com/ VET WILL CHANGE THE WORLD 

Imagine a world where every single product on a shelf has a number attached. Not a serial code or a price. I am talking about a carbon cost.

With the world rapidly changing and countries all over the world acknowledging the great need for greenhouse gas reduction, I believe we will see a HUGE awakening. Companies will start to be held accountable for how much pollution they emit. 

Let's look a real life example. An every day product. Consider a soccer ball for our example. The creation cycle of such a product consists of some key stages. The first stage is to gather the raw materials. The second is the manufacturer said materials into a sheet product that can be used to actually make the product. The raw material may get shipped, packaged loaded, unloaded and so on. Then the same thing over again if the materials are sent to a different factory for assembly. 

You can start to see the creation cycle of a product. You can literally calculate the caron footprint of making that soccer ball. 

How does this matter? Open  your eyes stupid. BLOCKCHAIN IS GOING TO TRACK THIS. The VET CEO has already been cryptic in his tweets about ""carbon is the new gold"" and so on. 

So there it is. I imagine a world were every single thing you buy will be stamped with a carbon cost. This will inevitably force manufacturers to change the way they make things. 

If companies are held accountable for not only the cost of manufacturing to product but also the cost to our planet,  we would start to see a really positive change for the planet.

Unbelievable fellas, invest in MyLottoCoin project! This is the fresh hype topic of the blockchain world. Soon, we will dominate in the DeFi field. You can check $MYL token for the beginning, trustworthy project, imho. I‚Äôve already added to my wallet [removed] Anyone in on OPEN token? It shot up and I jumped on it and did a few quick 4-6% trades as it climbed today. It just bought and sold so fast I got sucked in. Ended up caught holding the bag at 0.0000078 ETH after gaining about 20% before that spike died down and consolidated. That was some strong movement for a while though and I think I‚Äôm going to sit and wait rather than panic sell since it historically keeps coming back again. Anyone who has followed it or looked at the charts, do you think it will break this resistance line? It‚Äôs been stuck under the 0.000008 ETH mark since March and keeps touching and moving up maybe 1 point each time. Does anyone use incognito ? https://incognito.org/

I want to know why the price difference is so much??

I understand prices are slightly different for same coin at different exchanges. But I have never seen around 50% price difference. 

Can anyone help explain this. [removed] Hello everybody,

IMPORTANT \* today is a HUGE day for BONFIRE.

It'll be list on Whitebit exchange, and there is the live AMA today at 4pm EASTERN. 

This is the most promosing coin I have in my wallet, be sure to AT LEAST check it out. 

Have a good day y'all ! Made my first ever Etherium purchase on CoinSquare in Canada last week. It's seen a nice bump since. I want to buy a bit in my LIRA also so I'm considering the CI fund ETHX.U fund.  Have a couple questions

1. If I just want to buy and hold, not really trade, should I keep my ETH in CoinSquare or should I get my own keys and somehow store them myself?
2. If the ETHX.U fund a good option for investing in ETH for the long term?

https://denizdozer.medium.com/ Hey all, just wanted to say LETS GOoOoOOoO! What you guys think of Safemoon? Is crypto subject to real-world economic issues? Such as 1) If the $ amount rises for the same goods then does it increase for the same amount of crypto as well and 2) does the crypto economy fall along with the real-world economy? Out of interest why are charts for majority of cryptos pretty much identical the ones i follow are ADA-ETH-XLM-BTC like seriously why are they all the same?

Only answer is bots are trading and ppl are doing whatever some join bots and loose others can figure out what bots gonna do and win..

So please someone tell me why majority of cryptos charts are literally identical to some degree..? especially true now when they are going down

Just look at the charts now they match almost perfectly LOL, not manipulated at all, just all the people around the world decided they will sell exactly same coins at exactly same time.. yeah sure...

I bought 100 SOL at $10 and sold at $30 lol What I want to know is how the heck is Sol the only crypto not crashing right now ü§îü§î maybe it‚Äôs their that lol Everyone is talking about SOL, which admittedly is doing awesome, but not many are paying attention to FTM which has consistently out performed SOL over the past 30 days.

I'm not a SOL hater, I love SOL. I'm just loving those FTM gains. People don‚Äôt get fundamentals so the missed out thinking at $65 it was too high, then the same at $110 and $140 thinking it will fall. I know this was fast and not even dogecoin surged like this, but fundamentals were there and a 50bln mcap could have been expected Good thing I put a hundred bucks last week. ü•≥ Those who have been expecting \#Solana to cool off have been sadly mistaken. Dominance of \#crypto discussions related to $SOL have soared on its 154% rise since late August en route to its latest \#AllTimeHigh of $172.95.

Eth alright one of my minor question is according to Turtle coin. What does it mean that they condensing supply will hit 100k to 1 in november and how to perceive it as a newbie in crypto? I want to decrease the liquidation price on my ADA/USDT perpetual contract (long), would it make sense if I realized a small percentage of my current ADA profits by converting it to USDT and thus decrease the liquidation price?   


I'm still learning (dw, I'm only playing with money I can afford to lose) so sorry if my question doesn't make much sense, feel free to ask more questions to clarify.

&#x200B;

p.s. I'd appreciate some comment upvotes so I can participate more in the sub, new to reddit (sorry if the plug ain't allowed lol I will edit if need be) Beware of this token https://www.smudgetoken.org/
I am not an expert of cryptos but it seems to be an obvious scam. It's in presale so you have to send bnb or eth to a wallet to get the tokens. It's said on the litepaper that it would be listed on tier 1 CEX in April but they keep postponing even few days ago it was said to be listed on hotbit on the 20th May but they find shady excuses to postpone. On their website it's said they are partners with london daily post an Yahoo finance and other big names and now they say the listing is confirmed on hotbit for 31 May but when asked they show absolutely no proof neither for the partnering or for the listing. I think you will never be able to sell it because it will never be listed on any exchange
But the most phony thing is the contract. They say the max supply is 100 000 but when you look at the ETH contract they give it says 

contract SMUDGETOKEN is Token{
    
    constructor() public{
        symbol = ""SMUDGE"";
        name = ""SMUDGE"";
        decimals = 18;
        totalSupply = 50000000000000000000000;  
        owner = msg.sender;
        balances[owner] = totalSupply;
    }
    

Total supply =50000000000000000000000

I tried posting the contract on the telegram but i got muted. There is actually more than 73000 people on the telegram, I dont understand how an obvious scam like that can get that maby people in ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï\_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ ETH TAKE MY ENERGY ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï\_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ Market is being crabby today ü¶Ä ü¶Ä ü¶Ä Loving the crypto dip right now. People may hate it, but gives early adopters like is more time to buy ‚ù§Ô∏è Is this where I post to get karma points to comment elsewhere?

Mod will answer. I am a new crypto investor. I‚Äôve been in about 2 months. I‚Äôm curious about something. I‚Äôve noticed the market dips every Friday. Is this the norm?  I don't have enough karma to post yet. But I don't want to post an empty comment. So I hope you like it. Please give me some good karma if you like it. Thanks my fellow hodlers. 

K, here's a poem. The dog, with no tail, will never know the agony of chasing it. 

I guess that's more of a prose. Bought the CRV dip then it dipped & dipped & dipped & dipped...... [removed] Best buys during the dip?
(Don't say MATIC, I missed this one again and I'm still fragile) I‚Äôm considering polkadot, chain link, and polygon. What does anything think of these ???? Can anyone ELI5 yield farming?

What are the risks and costs?

Also, any free karma helps...I cannot post in regular threads due to lack of karma [removed] Guys please give me a link to the guy that has invested 1000USD in the top 10 cryptos since 2018 üöÄüöÄüöÄ [deleted] Looking for a reason to think Lukso won‚Äôt 100x or more. So people here are not discussing anything worthwhile... only increasing their karma. 
I really want to get into commenting on posts Anyone else blow $100k on the Dogee hype train at $0.70? Who wants to buy a well used, still serviceable wife at a knock down price? Hurry though, I'm throwing in a one time limited offer of a free, ready made kid to sweeten the deal... I am pretty amazed at the lack of this subs engagement with Tezos (XTZ)

It's a really fucking cool project, very innovative. Similar to Cardano but arguably better Are we going to see massive dip again? Or things are getting better? If it becomes a bear market you would still buy and DCA right? Or am I missing something? We have a long way to go as far as legitimacy is concerned, particularly if Elon Musk can swing the market by tweeting. Also, I'm guessing at this point it's institutional investors who are listening to him? If so, our economy is screwed. Guys, where do you buy BTT? 
Fm
I really want to buy 1m BTT and leave it there and come back in 5 years. I heard so many good things about it and I‚Äôm hoping that since it is still very cheap I can grow my money hopefully after years. May you all be rich tonight! A formula for massive gains in crypto.

It has become apparent to me that the people who truly make good money in crypto are the ones who honesty forgot they had coins or just heard about it in the news and remembered they bought some back in the day. When they go to check their wallets they are millionaires. To that end, there are people who felt like they missed out because they had the chance to buy bitcoin back when for dollars a coin. What they fail to realize is if they had bought and been tracking the crypto markets, they likely would have sold when they doubled or tripled their initial stake, not realizing that it was going to 100x or 1000x in the future.

My plan is to put $1000 across maybe three coins, one of which being SHIB. I feel that crypto has shown before with DOGE that it will blow up on meme coins for no underlying fundamental reason, and SHIB is a meme to a meme, as it is the coin proposed to take down DOGE. I plan to buy these coins, and delete the crypto app from my phone and try my best to put it out of my mind until I literally see it in the news or reddit years from now, the only reason it gets in the news is if it had an explosive run, which is my indication to review the chart and potentially sell. I don‚Äôt want to watch the market before then because I don‚Äôt want a 5x,10x, or even 100x win on $500 because its not life changing money. I want to see a reddit post say ‚ÄúSHIB about to break one dollar!‚Äù and check it to see my $500 stake in a 100000x position (currently trading at .00001). 

Perhaps I never hear these coins names again in my life, in which case I lose out of $1000 over the course of my life. But perhaps its randomly 23 years from now and I hear the name SHIB mentioned at an airport and go to check and see that I‚Äôm a multi millionaire.

Thoughts? Aaaand now we're in Solana.

Love me some big dipperoni. I feel like a sandbag: if i am in, i pull down, if i quit it flies..., seemingly recently i purchased. what up with the GEM industry, dead? Wow, quiet in here. Everybody's had enough and gone on vacation Aiight, back up we go Portfolio now: 100% ADA üòÖüöÄüöÄ I‚Äôm new to Cypto but have previous experience in equities and commodities trading. Question if I may, when researching a coin, I understand market cap v coins in circulation etc but when I come to actually researching a coin, what are the key indicators, what are the warning signs, I was trying to find out some information on Student Coin (STC) on KuCoin but it‚Äôs not even on coin gecko, any help would be appreciated I do understand the reasoning for karma requirements. When I started commenting, they were worthless, empty comments, hoping I'd get a laugh or sympothy upvotes.

Now, the more I post, the more I want it to mean something besides humor or spewed shit. 

From now on, I will strive for meaningful constructive comments. So I got a follower today. I thought it was cool to have someone like my post enough to click the follow button. 

Then II checked out the page and it was some bleepin' person wanting me to check out their nasty ass sex page. For money. 

What's up with that? People showing off their sex for money!!! üí∞ üòí  

Maybe they don't realize they're whores. I don't know what's up with our world these days. 

Trash is, as trash does. 

Where's Waste Management when you need them? Hi guys, I‚Äôm trading crypto for 4 years(holding and trading futures). 
I got 112 000$ from my spot acc beginning with 500$ in 2017 now I will try risky game.
First, I will deposit 100$, LONG  coins to get 100% price increase per deal.      
I calculated that I have to 2x my balance 13 times and 1 time 25% increase from 100$ to get ~1.000.000$.   
Now I‚Äôm waiting more bearish trend bcz now I don‚Äôt see something bullish.
It‚Äôs risky and long-time sh$t, but more interesting than just hodl money in one coin(xrp hodlers know what was in January).   
First rule of trading crypto - don‚Äôt use whole balance in one deal!    
it‚Äôs experiment, just interesting what will happen. 
I need more karma to post this title and always keep you Informed. Sorry for eng, I‚Äôm from Russia if I did any grammar mistakes lol. Does anyone here have experience with Block-fi?
Also, thoughts on BTC movement since yesterday afternoon? 100% ADA üòÅ In kind of glad now that coinbase is taking so long for funds to settle. Because of long wait it actually saved me money by not letting me buy when everything dropped Matic We are in an unprecedented time, a grace period for the less fortunate to find stability in the next financial crisis of this century.  Also a time for day traders to 10x their investment way before we even see the end of this Bullrun. Those who saw this coming and made the moves to sell high and buy low are gaining not only wealth but immense power.

Those who choose to follow a career path involving blockchain development will seize an opportunity to be a superhero of the 21st century. This is the next step in planetary unification, beyond the ink and bold print this is a technology that will save the world.

&#x200B;

Not only think about the gains, think about the power, independence, freedom we will have, we just have to make a commitment and use our values and apply them, this is not a game of stocks, not even for the day trader, anyone who participates is taking on a responsibility to change this world and have a purpose beyond the ordinary mundane roles that humans have taken on for centuries.

&#x200B;

My message is to choose carefully, apply your own philosophy, and not only look at the future of your finances, look inside and see this is not only a chance to rise above economic slavery but a chance to make a difference and actually fight for what's truly ours. Many more trials will be faced by those in this Crypto Economy, there will be setbacks and an attempt by the banks and government to win power, but THIS IS OUR GAME AND WE WILL WIN!

&#x200B;

Love,

Tetra ADA now = all of the ‚Äúdamn shoulda bought bitcoin back in the day‚Äù regrets every broke ass person has you guys think it coins will go up steadily from now? This is the end of crypto. Governments are cracking down on it and outright banning like Michael Burry predicted. Dump and sell everything. big oofs It seems the entire crypto market is down 50% across the board. Is there precedent for this? Is this a dip or a crash? Why do all the buy-side apps crash when markets are down?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS1M2VBT4mc [removed] So I've never invested in crypto before and I wanted to right before this dip but I stopped myself. What would you do in my situation now? Buy now? Just wait? Buy a little now and a little bit later? [removed] Does anyone know why Bondly isn‚Äôt showing for me on Bittrex?  I see the wallet for deposits and withDs but don‚Äôt see the pair. [removed] What do you think about stopelon coin? What do you think about TRON being the blockchain with the largest amount of USDT? 
Ethereum has about 28bi, and Tron currently has 32bi. As we have seen, USDT issuances are not really backed by fiat, but by ""unspecified commercial papers"" and one of those could simply be debt to the Tron foundation or other tron-related organisation. 

If a sudden lack of trust hit the Tron blockchain, it would be a huge source of fragility to USDT and, by that, to the crypto market as a whole. It seems to me quite irresponsible from Tether to issue this amount of USDT on a ecosystem that is not receiving  much trust from the crypto community and/or market. [removed] Should I trade some BTC for ETH now? Or wait for BTC price to increase. Wtf is going on with USDT? It's value is going up and down in my Binance portfolio Anyone trading on ACDX exchange?

https://denizdozer.medium.com/ Damn you coinbase for crashing all morning during the massive dip. That‚Äôs all I got to say Hi! I don‚Äôt have enough comment karma to post so hoping someone here can help. (Sorry if this is against the rules, I‚Äôm impatient). 

What does it mean if I increase the leverage in a futures contract? I‚Äôve noticed that it allows me to purchase more ADA, but I‚Äôm confused as to why my PNL(ROE %) goes up more when I increase the leverage and my actual PNL remains the same. Hopefully this is enough info to go off of. 

Any help appreciated :) Daily Crypto News | 21.05.2021

https://denizdozer.medium.com/ Guys I think the next week will be shaky! Just store your coins and never look back! That‚Äôs my plan! Keeping my mental health... Why do crypto values crash on Mondays? 
Every week I see this trend. I looked. I promised I would not look today. guys halp Wtf is happening across all crypto market? USA will wake up to a shock ü§Ø I have decided to buy for the first time ever during this dip. I have a decent idea of what I'll buy but what would you buy if you were investing $500? 700 Million Reasons the Dogecoin Bubble Will Burst  
This hype-buoyed cryptocurrency is a house of cards that‚Äôs teetering on disaster.  
  
For more than a century, history has been pretty clear: Investing in the stock market has been one of the most-effective ways to build wealth over time. Although we‚Äôve seen assets like housing and commodities like gold have their day in the sun, they‚Äôve not come close to matching the long-term total returns (including dividends) of the broader market.  
  
But this long-term strategy of buying and holding stocks has seemingly been put on the back burner since cryptocurrencies made their debut. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two-largest digital currencies by market value, both traded well below $1 following their inception and now go for around $50,000 and $4,000 per token, respectively.  
  
Yet it‚Äôs not Bitcoin or Ethereum that‚Äôs been generating the most buzz on Wall Street in 2021. Rather, joke cryptocurrency Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) has been all the rage.

https://denizdozer.medium.com/ If you missed the sell signal, next best thing to do is to not miss the buy signal when prices are low! Possible scenario, if $BTC sees a bounce from here, holds the daily 200MA, but contained by the weekly 20MA. [WXY, BTC scenario](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/s/sz29li0o.png) Is this is a coordinated attack on crypto communuity? All I can see is bloodbath on literally all coins.  Though I will still HODL. On noticing that my portfolio had experienced a slight dip today, I set about researching the value of my kidneys (I'm sure that I can spare one).

Also searching for my wallet to check that the ¬£20 emergency pizza reserve is still there and hasn't been devoured by plastic-munching moths. If you had $100 to invest, what would you buy atm?

I‚Äôm very very new to it. A lot of the ones I see recommended I‚Äôm not able to buy on the platform I use (which is all I‚Äôm confident with using for now) Does anyone know of any good signal channels to follow on telegram or discord What's our take on loopring? So I am panicking because I purchased some doge in 2013, and today I figured out that the price is around 0.30, and I got 18000000+

I'm looking to take some risk and make a good amount of money (few hundred dollars) relatively fast. I'm more into the idea of longer term gains but need to generate enough money in the first place to put into something more stable like Ethereum. I figured if I could quickly make some money investing in other coins while Ether and other longer term coins are down, I could put anything I profit into Ether for example before it hopefully takes off again. Even if we are in a bear market, I doubt we are going to stay in it very long. Also plenty of ways to make money on a bull market. Time to panic sell Eth?

I need an exchange that allows bot trading and also help in choosing the right bot (AI/manual input on trades).  What would you guys suggest for a newbie to Crypto?  I need the exchange to have BTC, ETH, ETC, DOGE, BCH, and really the ability to trade all coins as the come available.  I have learned in my short time that BTC and a handful of other coins are ones that will be around, but other coins can be profitable if multiple trade orders are allowed.  HODL is not the most profitable way to make money in crypto with it‚Äôs current volatility.   My problem is not having the ability to set multiple trade orders so I can profit on highs and save losses on lows at the same time.  I would have to monitor the crypto market 24/7, which is impossible, or I‚Äôd have to invest a lot of money in an app like CryptoSignal.  Let me know what other US based traders are using.  I need an exchange with bot/AI based trading built in or one that I can integrate through API‚Äôs to initiate multiple types of trades.  I have been able to find some of what I need in certain exchanges but help would be appreciated to find an exchange and bot/AI integration that meets all of them.  Thanks for helping the newb out!

3,Different platforms to invest in to generate passive income,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/uup50v/different_platforms_to_invest_in_to_generate/,"There are various options for earning money that don't require you to put in constant work. Staking crypto is one method that has gained popularity and still continuing to do so, especially with the current market conditions.


I assume you agree on this one? What are your thoughts? I don't see any reason to disagree with, unless you have no experience with the crypto world and prefer banks.

Many platforms exist that will pay you a reasonable APY. Some prefer decentralized platforms, while others prefer centralised ones. Where you fit in is entirely up to you.

You might want to take a peek at these. It may or may not be known to you, but it may be useful in assisting you in switching platforms at your own risk.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Coinbase 

It offers a simple staking solution for their staking-supported crypto on their exchange, with the added benefit of no minimum staking requirement, according to their article.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Cryptocom

According to what I've read, Crypto com's mobile apps offer both flexible and fixed term staking with a few touches. Everyone has the opportunity to earn up to 14% APY. This platform is user-friendly, and even newbies will find it to be an ideal platform for crypto staking.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Teneo Finance

Teneo allows holders to hold BTC, ETH, and other crypto assets while still earning from trading in the turbulent market, as long as those assets are minted into tenBTC, tenETH, and so on. (1 ETH is equivalent to 1tenETH etc).

The original assets are stored safely in the contract. I'm impressed on how Teneo's farming system works as they'll gradually reduce emissions as they attract capital. Investors should benefit from a low slippage switching opportunity at DEXs by rewarding tenXXX!

4Ô∏è‚É£ Stake Fish
It's completely non-custodial staking service where they run public validator nodes on many crypto networks. This service has something in common with My container that also share masternode staking service. For me, it's pretty much unique way to earn.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Ramp DeFi - I found out that you can earn yields while you borrow rUSD stablecoin.

You just need to mint stablecoin against your deposited assets and pursue new opportunities. They'll be rebranding in the coming months for a better change!

These are the few platforms I wanted to share with you based on my personal experience, but I'd also like to hear from you about which platforms are working for you. After all, we all desire a long-term platform from which we may gain and we can benefit from each other's experiences and contribution.

So please share your ideas and feel free to discuss any platforms that you believe are suitable for everyone.",7,27,False," My friend is using cryptocom , I'm not so familiar with teneo and fish. I do also hold ebox that gives me  passive rewards. Yeah i agree that staking is one of the reasons why we hold to other project. Passive income never fades. Came across the APY on Spool despite being a middle ware. Ranges from 13% to 17% with stablecoins including USDC, DAI and USDT. Since it is automated with ready made yield strategies, I think it is more suitable for anyone who doesn't understand the dynamics of how DeFi work, especially in a bear market like this. How does Teneo work? Are there rewards in ETH-BTC or are they paid in stable coins?  
Long time I didn't hear anything about Ramp. Is that still a thing? What about using liquidity pools on wowswap? I really like the passive income opportunities for Teneo Finance especially after they have added FTM and LINK which is one of my favorite token holds of all time. I'm now farming some of them and just earning up to 70% APY on average diversified on their different pools. Reflows aspect is fun as well. I basically put my CAKE bags into tenCAKE last month because of their APYs that time and I think I made the right decision for holding pegged tokens on Teneo. Where I can just convert my funds at any moment without worrying about some extra fees to pay unlike with common DEX staking platforms. Have a coinbase account but haven't really gotten the hang of the staking part though. For now I just stick to yield farming on stablecoins as that way I get to avoid volatility and secure my funds. Diversifying investments would also go a long way in making sure users don't get caught in sticky situations and lose everything like what happened with Luna and Ust. Just be aware that staking your coins relinquishes ownership of them. 

Thousands just lost everything staking on Terra, a stablecoin that de-pegged, and its associated coin Luna, so be aware that even with respected exchanges there are other risks too.

If the interest APY is high, so is the risk.

If earning free coins or money just by staking them and doing nothing sounds a bit too good to be true, you're probably right.

Far safer to DCA and hold by using a cold wallet. If you picked a good coin, that will, over time, reward you handsomely. And using a cold wallet means it's yours regardless of what happens.",0.9945

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",24,157,False," Cryptocurrency Traders in the Americas keep Cryptocurrency floating for the rest of the world - Check the trend. We are buying up China's fear.

You've been waking up every morning deeper and deeper in the red. And then things slowly pick up during the day. Only for a bigger drop of another 15%+ while you're sleeping.

Every day for the past month or so, the biggest drops in price happen while the America's are sleeping - whether it's Canada, USA, Central/South America, I can't say. It's probably collective.

The only explanation is the America's have been buying up China's (and the other countries that wake while we sleep) fear. This is suggested by the fact that more often than not, the prices of Cryptocurrency as a whole rebound as the America's are a wake.

What does this mean?

A few possible scenarios: 

If the America's stop buying as much, Cryptocurrency could plummet faster (not a bad thing or good thing depending on how you view it - buying opportunity or major dread).

Optimistic dip-buying American's should hold off from catching a falling knife and wait until there is a serious leveling out/dip. This won't present itself during the day because American's are lapping up Cryptocurrency creating the illusion there may be a bounce back, causing us to believe in a ""fake dip.""

This is not a pessimistic or optimistic view. But just an explanation of what could be happening. I have a question. Why is the crypto market dropping? I have been looking for information but can‚Äôt find any.. thanks in advance :) It just keeps going down I won't be done even if the price goes down 99.99% 

Fuck the market. 1 BTC = 1 BTC. Hey 
How exactly is El Salvador managing to price commodities in BTC?

Wouldn't they have to constantly change prices of all those commodities considering how volatile the market is?

And even if they manage to constantly change the prices,  wouldn't that basically imply the fact that the USD is still the go-to currency and BTC still an asset?

And how is the government of El Salvador benefited by using something as volatile as BTC? Hi Hello Crypto peeps! In your opinion, what percentage should creators own at the launch of a bep 20 token! Thanks in advance for any input! Hi everyone, I bought BTC at 53k price worth of 6k$ Now, it is at 35k price. How much do I need to invest more to make my avg cost as 35k?

Is there a downside or can I make money this way with no added taxes or anything? If I turn eth into beth on binance, and then stake in their eth 2.0 staking, can it be done? I'm only seeing an option to distribute eth into beth.

This is a great project, I saw several communities talking about this project. I am sure this project will be a success in the market. It is the most powerful centralized crypto trading platform. It is more secure that other platform.I hope this project will achieve more success. Developing Key Statistics and Fundamental Measurements for Cryptocurrency Investing and Trading  
  
(The original article is below)  
  
Article titled: Developing Key Statistics and Fundamental Measurements for Cryptocurrency Investing and Trading  
  
As of June 26, 2021, when you search cryptocurrency fundamentals or key statistics, you mostly see articles on blockchain technology or basic ideas to help people understand the main ideas around major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.  
  
When you research or invest in stocks, you look at fundamentals such as management, future outlook, and supply/demand of products, and services. You‚Äôll also consider key statistics such as debt, liquidity, price and earnings relations, and more.  
  
Anyone in commodities will have their own fundamentals such as expectations on demand, which countries are publicizing an increase in infrastructure funding, and if there is going to be an abundance of supply in the near future because of a new technology or resource site.  
  
All of those considerations are ways for people to analyze whether their investment will grow or not.  
  
With cryptocurrency being so new, now is a great time to start sharing this type of information so people can become aware of the opportunities to make money as cryptocurrency matures. In the future, there may be a website like CoinMarketCap that allows visitors to see these statistics and decide on trading opportunities.  
  
These ‚Äústatistics‚Äù will be very different than stocks due to the nature of investing in or trading virtual cryptocurrency. The following are just a couple suggestions of equations or ratios we can start using to evaluate cryptocurrency. More may come in the future, and the names may change.  
  
Percent of Total USD Currency (PTUC)‚Äî A measure of a cryptocurrency in value against the amount of Total USD in circulation.  
  
According to the government website, US Currency, there is currently over $2.040 trillion in US Currency in circulation. We can measure how much percent of a cryptocurrency compared to the total US Currency.  
  
Equation: Current Cryptocurrency Market Cap / Total USD Currency (latest figure)  
  
Example: Bitcoin current market cap as of 06/26/2021: $584,480,121,208584,480,121,208 / 2040700000000 = \~28.6%  
  
Analysis: Cryptocurrency being a combined total of all the worlds currencies (not limited to the USA) ‚Äî this can give us an idea of how ‚Äúhigh‚Äù this number can go which will most likely be more stable down the road. One will have to decide on a specific percentage‚Äù where it is reasonable for any single cryptocurrency to exceed. For example, if you believe Bitcoin should never exceed 80% PTUC, then it is probably still going to grow right now, but if the number was closer to 78%, you may be more cautious. But you might also use it for other cryptocurrency to measure it against the leading cryptocurrency (or MCR ‚Äî as defined below)  
  
Source: https://www.uscurrency.gov/life-cycle/data/circulation  
  
2. Market Cap Ratio (MCR) ‚Äî A measure of any single cryptocurrency against the current leading cryptocurrency.  
  
According to Coin Market Cap, the leading cryptocurrency is Bitcoin which should come as no surprise. At the very moment of writing this, the value of BTC at 06/26/2021 is $584,480,121,208 (and could change very quickly).  
  
Equation: Top Leading Cryptocurrency Market Cap Value / Selected Cryptocurrency Market Cap Value.  
  
Example: Bitcoin with a market cap of $584,480,121,208 and Dogecoin with a market cap of $30,847,414,070.  
  
$584,480,121,208 / $30,847,414,070 = 18.95  
  
Analysis: This ratio helps to determine the value of a selected cryptocurrency in relation to the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is currently has a ratio explaining it‚Äôs current market cap value at 18.95X that of Dogecoin. The number can be a measure for a number of things from value compared to other coins. This can be especially helpful when they are viewed side by side.  
  
3. Future Ideas ‚Äî Need an equation that compares the future rate of growth (depending on predictability of a cryptocurrency in terms of total supply) compared with current value.  
  
Any website can easily implement this by including some simple equations into their charts. As mentioned, this is a work in progress, so perhaps more people will come up with better ones in the future, plus an authoritative source.

Its initial goal was to enable a distributed network of computers to work continuously even under unpredictable unstable conditions. With the introduction of blockchain technology, consensus algorithms have been recognized on a larger scale. Simply put, a consensus algorithm is an agreement protocol implemented by a blockchain to verify all sorts of data.

An algorithm verifies newly added blocks of data, guarantees the legitimacy of the block, and is agreed upon by all members (nodes) of the decentralized network.[In this article, we will focus on a few of the most popular algorithms](https://getblock.io/blog/what-is-a-blockchain-consensus-algorithm-and-how-does-it-work/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo), discuss their working principles, and give some examples of where and how they are used.

POW isn't just a method of consensus, it's a method of blockchain authentication.

When new nodes connect to a blockchain network, the first thing they have to do is identify the genuine blockchain, so they can sync with it. POW makes this easy because the work in POW can be stored in the blockchain. In Bitcoin, the genuine blockchain contains more work than any fake blockchain can match.

Staking can't be used this way. A blockchain that uses POS must use a different, and undoubtedly less secure, method of blockchain authentication. This will result in chronic exploits that can never be fixed.",0.8975

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",27,295,False," why are prices going crazy right now? especially ETH?! Does anyone here also await the correction? [removed] Whats up with ethereum Breaking its chains? This Doge nonsense needs to stop. it could potentially damage other worthy projects in the crypto space. So people just invest in anything now? Is that the idea. We dont look for innovative and advanced projects and just put our money in a meme? Its like putting money in shares of thin air really, since it has no real purpose. Its price  is based on hype and hype solely. 50% of the supply is in about 10 wallets and these megawhales are going to burn all the regular holders when they choose to sell. I wont be investing in doge as i see no long term future for it, yes i see price increases right now due to hype, media attention and celebrity endorsements, but no reason for any long term price stability... I'll always be a safe coin holder and scouting for undervalued projects with real potential such as 'Safekey' or 'Vechain'. Not a silly coin that has no real purpose and an uncapped supply. I just worry that it's going to represent the crypto sphere as a joke rather than just the coin itself, therefore having a domino affect on other projects, and scewing new comers perceptions. What's the best way to get back into the investing in crypto? I got some mainstream coins in very small amounts way back in 2017 and after the big dip I decided to just forget about them and look back later. I didn't dca when the prices were low and now I feel like I missed out on big potential gains. Buying more now seems scary as almost everything is at ath. Any suggestions? I just started getting into Basic Attention Token **(BAT)** and now I'm using the Brave browser. I researched and it seems like a great premise, getting paid a portion of ad revenue and being able to tip sites/creators. Does anyone know of any flaws with the BAT technology? Can I short Doge through any of the exchanges? why is etherium going down when Dow Jones just announced that crypto is being introduced to wall street with crypto indexes.

Hey, I‚Äôm new, don‚Äôt know much but my cousin whom is an extremely wealthy NYC investor said he‚Äôs aware of a few high profile actors, athletes, basically, elite people told our other cousin that a few of those people dropped 100,000‚Äôs of thousands and will be putting much more into the Shiba coin throught the week. And told him it‚Äôll be up 6K percent fairly soon. It would be to awkward for me to call him bc we‚Äôre not really close. This dudes sketchy and I think he knows when stuffs manipulated but I‚Äôve been trying to buy some all day today and is confusing as hell. Is there an easy site I can just go on and get some? How do I move Matic from binance to a wallet. I use Guarda and it doesn't seem to support it. Do I need a different wallet? So Ive invested in siacoin and have some concerns based on some criticism of the business model that ive come across.

Ill post a link below but to put it short, a sia start up site voiced some concerns and were banned from the sia discord etc. Any help or opinions on the subject would be much appreciated.

I want my coins to be safe, but I don't want to lose 21% of my investment just to move them to my wallet. Any advice?? Is DOGE going to hit 50c?

Excited to be part of the community! [deleted] If you were to get into super risky but high reward opportunities what would you do? Any investor whales here? And how do you learn about up-and-coming coins to invest in on the ground floor? I got in with SafeMoon 2 days after public launch on a fluke (saw it trending on StockTwits). Looking for advice on how to scout them out before hand. Thanks! Here comes THETA! What resources do you follow on a regular basis to assist your trading? hey everyone wondering your take on the Neo token keep hearing about it on my twitter feed they keep saying that something called an N3 is coming soon and that means they are going to the Moon, don't know what an N3 is though???

wondering if someone could explain what an N3 is and why that means they are going to the Moon and how this will put them in the top ten as they also keep saying??? Theres so much shitcoin spam here.. Anyone in here trade on leverage? If so, roughly which percentage of you portfolio have you designated to the high risk play? Also, is it under 5x or have you gone the above with the boom or bust mentality. Really curious how many peeps are drawn into this high risk trading and your experience with it, Cheers!! ü§† AMP to the moon !!!! New to crypto. Planning to put $$ and wait at least 10 years. What‚Äôs going to be next bitcoin? Hey everyone, newbie in crypto here. So i decided to invest in a few cryptos (DOGE and XRP) and im still trying to wrap my head around things. Basically what i have difficulty in is, what is the difference between converting and selling? 

I managed to buy the coins with no problem (no surprise there), but say after i while, i wish to cash out, what do you suggest

I am using the Binance platform and also considering starting on Kraken. Is it better to ride this crash out or to exit positions? How long will this crash go on for, any estimations? New crypto

Where can i see new cryptos being released on the market and buy them? How is no one talking about Samemoon heading to the moon? Has anybody heard about ALGO? Hi guys i was watching the SAFEMOON bullrun, so i saw another token PAPELTOKEN but it looks suspiciously similar to SAFEMOON. 
What do you think? Just a reminder to collect your CoinGecko free candies Hey all, new to crypto and thinking about making smaller, bi weekly purchases for a year and then evaluating if I want to continue with this approach. 

Is this sensible?  What site/app would you reccomend for this? I did not understand the choice of the masses to take refuge on $DOGE to make a profit ...

https://denizdozer.medium.com/ So I've read tons of threads about the dip and the taxes thing...

1 - The numbers are a rumor by Bloomberg, not a reality or announcement

2 - Capital gains occurs when you actually make profit, therefore when you sell, not when you hold

I understand people also trade, but until we get formal measures voted and applied, why worrying?
The whales might be freaking and that's just good news!

My humble opinion : be safe, relax, enjoy the cheap coins and HODL !

As usual, no financial advice, just common sense and opinion :)
What's your standpoint Cryptoers? 120% HBAR because:
- in simple words it solves the same problems as blockchain networks like BTC/ETH but way faster, with extremely low fees, and with a tiny carbon footprint
- it‚Äôs more decentralized (39 reputable council members - try getting 3 people to agree on anything now 39 organizations) than any other coin being managed by a handful of core developers 
- it has real-world use cases today (unlike others)
- it dominates in TPS (recently crossed 1B tx - took only 19 months), finality time, fees (fraction of a penny), low energy consumption
- it has a tokenization service (HTS) at the native layer without smart contracts (supports smart contracts too)
- guarantee of no forks (this matters for many users and use cases)
- they‚Äôre not marketing to us (dumb retail investors and consumers), instead they‚Äôre marketing to enterprise users and use cases and it‚Äôs working. When all those use cases get more exposure the price is gonna sky rocket and then our dumb retail money is going to follow and that‚Äôs when we‚Äôre all gonna wish we had HBAR now God bless you All today if you're reading this.... Let spread ü§éü§éü§éü§éü§é [removed] I'm in UK, noticed that since crypto never sleeps, it can be divided into 3 sessions per day, in my case, 8 in the morning 2 afternoon for usa and 2 in the morning for china/South Korea.

Hello all. New world to be this crypto. Trying to follow basic investing philosophy, buy on the dips. Hey guys, kind of new to reddit and im trying to raise my comment Karma, do i just simply keep posting comments on everything i see? I dont want to be a pain in the ass, but cheers. I just jumped on the doge train.. we need to Wall Street bets this crypto üöÄ Why are people being ignorant about the damage that Dogecoin is going to have, is having, on the crypto space? Let‚Äôs go peeps. Make Crypto go boom. üöÄ Except for Doge, Doge bad. $SLT Platform launch announcement is expected this week.  First mover in tokenized assets and securities with tokens backed by real assets such as Real Estate.   Fee redistribution (33% of platform fees paid out to token holders) for anyone staking over $1000.00 worth of tokens paid out monthly.   Definitely think about looking into Smartlands - could very well change the world. Hey Guys,

I am new to crypto investing and the community. I have been researching alot on the background of differents block chains before investing in it.

I came across alot of people who don't understand the network and buy based on market sentiment which works for short term trading but I think to hold long term you really need to understand the block chain.

To contribute to the crypto community in my own way I stated a blog and try to explain the block chain in simple English as much as possible.

Would really appreciate if you crypto guru's could take a few minutes to see the effort that I have put in and make any recommendations that you guys have.

Yo anybody wanna sell me 20$ worth of Akita Inu Token please ? Thx Can anyone help me I have a problem with trust wallet not wanting to sell bnb [ Price/Volume datasets - where to obtain ]

Hi all, wondering if anyone could help me out (I am not able to post to main thread :( )...

I would like to do some time-series signal / correlation, outlier etc analysis - are there any relatively ""fresh"" (last 3 months/last 6 months/last year) datasets out there that can be obtained? I have looked at kaggle and similar sources, and while there are some semi-recent ones, most are too old for the analysis I would like to do... I could of course use apis to capture what I am looking for, but that requires time to get to any meaningful volume of data, so if anyone has/can suggest the sources, I would be grateful. [removed] I'm new at this. Want to buy coins only available on Uniswap such as ARMOR. Am I correct in seeing that if I buy $300 worth of Armor, I'll have to pay like $85 in ether gas fees for the trade? Seems ridiculous. Does anyone know what's going on with CAPITAL X CELL gains on CoinMarketCap??  Is it just a glitch in the price tracking or what? I am from the future.  Sell now.  Re buy on the dip 5 days from now!!! Is the dip over or just the beginning? Where‚Äôs the best place to buy crypto? All I have is coinbase, I turned 18 on the 14th and am in a position where I can‚Äôt get a regular job. So I started to buy crypto. Safe\*insert animal here\* - Why?

I get that there was SAFEMOON and SAFEMARS and the likes that exploded, but is there anything novel about any of these? I've been shilling WAIVLENGTH all day because it has an interesting end use-case and I'd like to see it come to fruition, but there are so many others too that are actually trying to do good. Can someone point me towards tokens with real-world potential use-cases below? Not interested in another currency exclusively sticking to NFT's and reflection protocols... Still fairly new, so if this is just a dumb idea my apologies. 

I‚Äôm thinking about buy and staking USDC to further diversify my portfolio and having additional money ready for big dip days. I planning on keeping this a smaller portion of my portfolio.

[removed] Hi. There is a crypto called gCn Coin, it's not worth anything and you can't buy it ATM. Exciting I know. I'm mentioning this because I thought I'd tell people about it.
Disclaimer: I do own gCn.
gCn was effected but the 51% hack from a couple of years ago and was unable to guarantee security to investors. It took itself off many exchanges (including the gCn owned exchange) and was also taken off others. 
The owner announced a couple of months ago that they were unable to fix the code and will be announcing a Swap coin. 
I have been a holder of gCn for many years and everything the developer announces.... he does.
So although I hold gCn and 'yes' I hope for it's success, it believe it could be worth putting on your radar. üö® Smartlands SLT üö® platform launch this month and tier 1 exchange coming üî• Is Safemoon safe? This week new Token Listing on whitebit

https://denizdozer.medium.com/ cool! Magic going up! What's everyone's expectations? What did everyone buy this dip? Is anyone aware of or have come across individuals/groups which provide paid research and insights into different cryptocurrency/blockchain-based projects?

Search engines are not very helpful in that regard, I would assume that if these individuals/groups exist then they find clients through word of mouth and communities. I like the rule about being excellent to eachother. But tbh from what I have been reading here these folks are a step or two above the usual group mongrels. Nice to meet everyone. hey guys and girls,
I started staking ADA on Exodus. I staked 50 ADAs after 7 days I bought another bunch of 100 ADAs. My question is, does the staking implies now the 150 ADAs or is the staking fixed on the 50 ADAs? $ryo should be ranked in the top 10 cryptocurrencies, it is very undervalued right now. I said $ryo is undervalued some days ago. It has started rising now, it is up 1000% in the last 24 hours. 42,000$ MC

t.me/angrygori Is anyone else amazed by seeing the growth in $ryo price? Most coins are in dip today while it is mooning. $ryo is doing great today. It is 11x the price of yesterday. $ryo is a very useful coin because of its privacy and security and it has much upward potential because it is highly undervalued right now.

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",12,90,False," I‚Äôm starting to lose faith in doge guys‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt fathom who‚Äôs selling at 21 cents I just got scammed this week really bad! Be careful out there! Don't buy anything. The heavy investors and whales who jumped on the wagon from 2018 onwards are bailing now!

The central banks and regulators are coming for crypto exchanges.  You guys wanted crypto to be a recognized asset, you wish is granted.  

I expect BTC to fall as far as 10k, ETH all the way down to $100, DOGE and SHIB are jokes anyway, they will be worthless.  And xrp LTC sol will all be penny stock coins. Crypto adoption at its highest and prices stabilizing. 

What are your thoughts on people still shorting this assets? [removed] There is no sign of a reversal (yet) after an almost vertical climb on SAND with huge volume spike. Wtf??

As per the statistics record of the latter period of 2020, Ethereum has more than 200,000 compatible tokens existing on Ethereum's main network.

3,NFTs and Art Industry: Who Benefits from New Web3 Euphoria,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/vctr5t/nfts_and_art_industry_who_benefits_from_new_web3/,"When Beeple‚Äôs digital collage of pictures named ‚ÄúEVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS‚Äù was sold for 69.3 million dollars, even premier auction houses wanted to hop in on the new trend. Today, the NFT-based artwork is auctioned off for millions of dollars. Could the art industry benefit from blockchain technology? How could NFTs impact the art industry as a whole? Let‚Äôs find out. 

The art industry is keen on adopting the new technology due to two main reasons: NFTs provide ownership and scarcity. Besides, the trading is done on a public ledger with traceable and unforgeable tokens. Hence why the technology is fully decentralized and inclusive.

You could be thinking ‚ÄúWhy do we even need to pay millions of dollars to prove the authenticity of a digital art piece? Let‚Äôs say I want to take a screenshot of some art I found online and post it on my social media. Can‚Äôt I just do that?‚Äù. The answer is simple - yes, you can always download a .jpg file for free. To NFT buyers, however, the idea of owning an original piece of digital art is what stores the value.

Some critics believe that the current NFT craze is just a fad with no future prospects. While that could be true, what‚Äôs undeniable is that the world keeps talking about NFTs. Let‚Äôs discuss some pros and cons of using the new NFT technology in the context of art.

## How does the art industry benefit from NFTs?

* **Proof of ownership**
* **Stable income**
* **Worldwide recognition**

## NFTs downsides

* **Not eco-friendly**
* **Susceptible to hacks**
* **Volatile**

## [Could NFTs become the future of art?](https://getblock.io/blog/nfts-and-art-industry-who-benefits-from-new-web3-euphoria/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)",1,4,False," NFT [pros](/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/vctr5t/nfts_and_art_industry_who_benefits_from_new_web3/icg7e5b/) & [cons](/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/vctr5t/nfts_and_art_industry_who_benefits_from_new_web3/icg7em2/) and related info are in the collapsed comments below.

Mods aren't bothered anymore I guess Hi everyone, relatively new to crypto and new to staking.  Right now most of my ETH is in Coinbase or Trust Wallet.  Noticed I can stake on both... is one better than the other?  Is there a better option than both of them?

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",16,137,False," Bro is is possible to go a week without the markets and coins getting clapped. I mean I don‚Äôt the need the funds I have invested but what the hell. I have officially joined the crypo game. 500 on bit and 500 on eth now I just gotta forget about it for 7 years Bought my first bit Bitcoin, Ethereum and Doge yesterday. I don‚Äôt know if this is a ‚Äúbear market‚Äù as so many people have been saying, but I‚Äôm excited to finally be a part of the crypto ecosystem :] Between getting a DeFi insurance or getting into a defi risk parity service, which would you prefer for engaging in cross-chain yield farming? I'm currently stuck between these two options as I'm extremely afraid of losing my funds to rug pulls or even IL. Hello, now I have 200 dollars that I would like to invest in cryptocurrencies, which ones do you recommend?  
Thanks How long is everyone planning to hodl for? Will the market bounce back to what it was before? What do you guys think about $ADA? It took a dive today What % in what coin would you recommend as the highest chance 5x'ing your cash in 5 years? 

Here's what I'm thinking:

- 35% BTC
- 35% ETH
- 10%  VET
- 10% SOL
- 10% UNI/DOT/MATIC (choose one)

This is said with my personal belief that we'll see BTC at $100k and ETH at $10k in the next five years. Neither of which are 5x, so I'd need some help from an alt coin. I have 2k between bit eth doge and algo, wise to drop another grand on ada and cosmos (atom)? What do you think guys.. is this still consolidation or is this a drop back to the pre halting price?

https://twitter.com/BozkurtToken/status/1400153392023060482 What do y‚Äôall think of ElonTech? Any hope left for this one? Somebody stop me if this doesn‚Äôt make sense. If I were to buy cake and then stake it at the ~122% apr, and simultaneously short it on Binance, would I be making a guaranteed 122%? Of course this is assuming neither party is fraudulent and exit scams or something The more I listen, watch, and use, the more I see that defi is going to obliterate tradFi Every time I read the reports on the biggest gainers on Binance, I see that alts which are newly offered on Binance grow, at minimum, 300%. Does anyone have any data on how Binance picks which alts will be onboarded, how new alts regularly fare when onboarded (ave. growth, etc.), and a list of upcoming alts to be onboarded?  
I'm pretty new to investing but it's a trend that I see a lot. I have Trust Wallet and have used PancakeSwap before so I can purchase alts before they hit Binance. What are your thoughts? [removed] [removed] [removed] Bitforex Users - Perpetual Contracts - Trigger Price?  
  
Im currently looking at platforms for day trading crypto. Every trading platform is setup slightly different and many do a poor job explaining, in full, how they function. On Bitforex you have Spot Trading and Perpetual Contracts. In Perpetuals, you have the option of using Limit order or a Trigger Price order.  
  
I have been given TWO different answers to BOTH of these questions...  
  
1) When using a Trigger Price for a short, is the Trigger Price higher or Lower than the Limit Price? And for a Long, is it the same or reverse?  
  
2) Does my trade close, wrap up nice and neat, once my Price Limit has been hit?  
  
Any insight would be helpful. Please don't delete my message. How am I supposed to use this site if I can never post a gd question!? Please do not share a Google search. I am specifically asking the community for your personal experience trading.  
  
Thank you Guys, it‚Äôs there a way (copy/paste) to check a contract? It‚Äôs for a fair sale happening later and the dev has supplied the GitHub for the contract and I would like to check it‚Äôs safe or as safe as possible to ensure it‚Äôs not a rug, honeypot, etc. At what price did Tesla buy in at? Melt faces Is today the day to buy ICP at this heavy discount or is the future grim for it El Salvador becomes the first country ever to make bitcoin legal tender- where do you plan your next trip?

This is some science fiction shit [removed] PRESALE LIVE NOW. ENDS JUNE 10th 16:00 UTC

Keep in mind this is not my token nor am I not an official part of the team, I am contracted as a community manager and a shiller.

There is definitely risk involved in investing in this coin, especially since the presale is conducted OTC, so please do not invest any money you are not willing to lose. 

If you are uncomfortable with investing blind OTC, I recommend you wait until the Pancakeswap listing, when we will have a website and functional dapp. KYC and audit may be out by that time as well. 

I understand all the risks and personally have invested in this coin myself, since I believe in the idea of the project, especially the incredibly smart tokenomics.  
please do not accept any information except from an official pinned post from either me or CrossBSC. 

Public Presale is live until June 10th 16:00 UTC. 
Details are below in this same post.
FAQ at the end.

PUBLIC PRESALE DETAILS

Based on the feedbacks we have gathered from the public, we‚Äôll be deciding to hold a OTC presale, where the funds will be sent to a private wallet address, and in turn, both private sale & public presale will be airdropped before the launch happens.

As the private sale has garnered a larger sum than expected, we‚Äôll be increasing both softcap & hardcap of the presale, to further incentivise our community to try their best to spread the word, and also being fair to the public.

Why did we avoid both DXsale and UNIcrypt?

 1. Sniping bots into presale
 2. Bypassing of whitelist
 3. Fees
 4. CA being revealed and bots sniping the launch, causing a huge dump.
 5. Looking at the success of SHIELD, which the public offered to feedback, we have done analysed it and it was indeed not botted during launch.


Main details would be : 
Deadline : Thursday 16:00 UTC
100% Liquidity will be added. (90% will be locked for 2 years).
Private sale will be 20% lower of listing price (Due to each of them making a 0.3 donation for marketing funds)
Public presale will be 5% lower of listing price
Softcap : 500BNB
Hardcap : 1000BNB
Minimum contribution : 0.1BNB
Maximum contribution : 2BNB

Each unique wallet address should only send once to the wallet address given, any contribution by the same wallet exceeding 2BNB will be converting into funds to be used in marketing

*Please only send BEP-20 Binance Smart Chain (BNB BSC) to the following address, it is similar to a WALLET-TO-WALLET transfer*

0xaDf092460952b2e1735B75F14635ef135807003a

Please do not send it to any other addresses that is not pinned by me. Thank you.

Regarding doxxing and KYC

We‚Äôll be doxxing for 2 members of our team, while the rest are not comfortable to be public. However, KYC closer to the launch, I‚Äôll update it here again regarding if the entire team will get KYC-ed, or only 2 of our members. 

Do take note if you are not comfortable investing right now, you can decide anytime to invest in our project! However, we do hope you at least support our project at the launch! Cheers!

DETAILS ABOUT LAUNCH

What we‚Äôre planning to do is probably countdown 48hours to launch, to create even greater hype. And getting feedbacks for what insane marketing we can have. As during that period, our website and audit will be ready for the public, making it real insane.

FAQ

When does presale end?
June 10th 16:00 UTC

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",18,115,False," This is the most stable I‚Äôve seen crypto it‚Äôs almost boring lol doesn‚Äôt want to make swings up or down Why is the whole crypto market down 10% today? What happened? Here‚Äôs how the FBI reclaimed the btc from the pipeline hackers. They waited until the hackers transferred into an address where they had jurisdiction. 

https://imgur.com/a/B5WcDtj Is altcoin season over? The 4hr chart shows an almost perfect wyckoff accumulation, anyone else agree? If so it looks like we will consolidate between 42-45k this week before breaking out to the upside I put 500 usd into polygon(matic) at 1.32 with all of the movement their getting and partnerships like google. Anyone else think this could be a good move Omg! Bought my first bit of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Doge a few days ago. Very surprised with these price increases. I don‚Äôt know if this is a ‚Äúbear market‚Äù as so many people have been saying, but I‚Äôm excited to finally be a part of the crypto ecosystem BTC take off again üöÄüöÄ? Any thoughts on ETH? Not looking for financial advice just speculation! **Markets RSI, KDJ, MACD, BOLL!!**

Markets are choppy as hell this morning.  A lot of people buying off the back of a low weekend and in anticipation of the FED announcement.

**If the FED announcement is good.** Indicators say **BUY.** Sunday night was the best time to buy.  Today the price is up, but if the FED announcement is good things will take off. As usual a 4% surge would be followed buy a slight pull back.  If your timing is good and your margin account appropriated you can short the peak to make an extra few bucks and buy back in on the settled number.

**IF the FED announcement is not good!** Indicators say **Sell and buy back.** Have your marging account at a reasonable level as a short sale while the announcement is made may line your pockets. I would expect a sharp 4% dip on this news followed by a steady climb back.  Short & cover, then buy the dip for a slow climb back up.

Real potential there. What do you guys think? They say BTC is a ‚Äúinflation hedge‚Äù. What they don‚Äôt tell you is that its in a Bear Market, and will only benefit skilled professional traders instead of hodlers. 
Inflation is up by 5%, BTC went up by 500%. The trade is over, it came and went, and is already priced in. Surprised the ETH options expiry isn't a bigger thing in crypto news.

Math has been around for thousands of years. 2+2 will equal 4, and it will for another thousand years. I like the idea of investing in something reliable, honest, secure, and hundred percent certain. Bitcoin is a way to invest in certainty."" -Founder of Tudor Investments on CNBC

Best quote I‚Äôve seen on Bitcoin in a while. Need ETC to put its big boy pants on and get its ass to $80 [removed] seeing the market pumping or green today, I see the market very happy with this move, currently looking at the lending sector, I see more competition coming in taking a recent look at the total pooled money in curve and Aave, I see Baanx being a competitor in this sphere due to its partnership with Visa, Akoin and Tezos. This might not be the right sub/thread to ask this, so my apologies if so. 

Im wondering, do people commonly ‚Äúday‚Äù trade crypto? I use quotes because I don‚Äôt necessarily mean in and out on a day by day basis, but more buy and sell the same crypto with the rise and dips. Like, I got some btc in the low 30s, what‚Äôs wrong with me selling in the 40s now, with the intention of buying back in when it dips again? (Besides the obvious risk of it mooning). 

Honestly, I‚Äôm content with buying and hodling for 20+ years, that aspect really drew me into crypto. Buy and forget. But maybe I‚Äôm missing something. I don‚Äôt have a ton of capital to invest, so selling when I‚Äôm up and hoping for a dip is awfully tempting. Any insight appreciated. I'm trying to rebalance my portfolio. Please rank these by the order in which you think they're most likely to 5x over the next year or two. Highest chance to lowest:

* DOT
* UNI
* SOL
* MATIC
* VET

Ex: _DOT > UNI > SOL > MATIC > VET_ I wanted to post It on the main page but I don't have enough karma:


Dear fellow investors,

Yesterday I lost 95% of my ETH wanting to bridge it from binance to my MATIC wallet. Presuming I was doing the bridge I accidentally swapped a pair without liquidity and lost my investment.

Fwiw I‚Äôm a hodl‚Äôr, not a trader. Elon Musk sucks ass!  Dude is a scammer who could give a shit about anyone else.  He plays with the markets like it is a game.  He doesn't mind destroying someone else's wallet.  All fun and games for that asshole. Thanks to our good buddy Elon, a head and shoulders pattern is now forming on the large time frames... crypto has become a shit show Hi everyone. I recently made a large stake in Golduck after find their community driven goals and values extremely appealing. 
I think it could be the next 1000x if you get it before it hits the exchange. 
Of course, always invest with caution. :) 
I think it‚Äôs worth looking into for yourselves. Best of luck! https://golduck.org How is this even possible:

A project like IOTChain (ITC) that hasn't tweeted anything since april 2020 (soft exit scam?) has a marketcap of $7.7 million, while MFG - the token behind SyncFab - is working with clients like Lockheed Martin, and is being mentioned by MOBI alongside IOTA, Accenture, Ford, IBM... has a marketcap of only $3.7 million.

Source:
https://twitter.com/dltMOBI/status/1400178838722732035?s=20

Absolutely ridiculous.
MFG could be valued in the billions already, with some proper marketing, and nobody would question it. In reality, it currently has 0.10% of IOTAs marketcap. A new survey reports that there is rising adoption of cryptocurrency among Americans. Moreover, the study of Piplsay, backed by MarketCube, identified that 33% of Americans own a minimum of one type of digital asset.

4,NIM Technicals (very basic) more details in comments,https://i.redd.it/gzayi4lgoiz71.png,,4,44,False," Still very much an amaetuer when it comes to technical analysis, but thought I'd give it a crack on some crypto.  
NIMIQ is a sleeping giant in my opinion, the fundamentals, while still developing look quite promising, but we're not here for that, we're here to look at squiggly lines and hope they morph into something, or is that just the LSD?  
Again, I'm just a baby ape, still sucking the mummas tit on TA. NIM chart is looking like it has a long-term upwards channel currently happening (blue).  
Then there are two other triangle patterns in play over the medium and short-terms.  
The Yellow is a slight ascending triangle, that is looking for a breakout in that $0.0103-$0.0105 range, if this happens it should pop, especially with the current market environment.  
The red is a rising wedge, which looks like it's about to breakout in the same range of the ascending triangle.  
MACD is not on the favourable side for these, however, the RSI is in oversold territory, meaning it should turn and have a decent run after that.  
IMO in the short-term, this should have a good run ahead of it. Long-term it will grow but won't be a major growth until some further fundamentals come to fruition.  
If you have time, check out NIMIQ's community on here or on their website. Has a good team and solid foundation to bridge the gap between fiat currency and using to buy goods in bricks and mortar store using NIM and your phone.  
\*Any feedback on this chart from more experienced chartists would be greatly appreciated. Has anyone done a technical meta analysis - eg taken a whole bunch technical analysis and seen if long term it actually works (so as to remove confirmation bias) I remember reading recently some randomisation (puppy chosing which way to so or other such nonsense) outperformed all the best funds in the market.
This just looks like tea leaf reading, but I obviously could well be wrong.

4,My (technical) analysis for bitcoin the coming days. Tell me where I‚Äôm wrong.,https://i.redd.it/qpjqr5opnm391.png,,0,49,False," I think more sideways than down for a while Ta is wrong This technical analysis has some sense. I think that no one can predict the market exactly, but from the point of view of  probabilities, it really makes sense.  


Is there any chance to make the similar analysis for Kadena?   
I'm bullish on it, while some people just panic So basically it's either going down or up.

Wow, who would have guessed. How many people/traders do you know that make money trading ""divergences"", ""trend lines"" and lagging indicators like EMAs?

It's all fun and games drawing nice lines on charts and using lagging indicators like EMAs but I literally don't know a single person that is consistently correct using that sort of crap.

There's price action and that's literally it. There is Bullish divergence on the daily. RSI bearish on HTF.  First thing you should always do is invert the chart and check your bias. This is a bear flag consolidating in a box range. The oscillators reset allowing it go lower. Nobody knows exactly what can happen, but from technical perspective you should see more downside in the coming weeks.

And all of the morons who make fun of TA. The Japenese used forms of candlestick trading for 300 years.The Legacy market has people who went to all of the best colleges in the world and have been using western style TA for what 80 years? Trillions of dollars assets have been traded based on it. Literally 70% of the money in the world. So some dumbfuck neck beard can say its a joke, Why ? because he is ignorant. Gain 32k = upwards , Lose 29k = down , all you need to know. Overall on the daily we're still trending down. We just rejected at 32k so that's a sign of weakness. Until we gain anything significant on the upside it's either sideways or down Nice My astrology sign is leo Zoom out. Ta is like astrology for men... pointless I am someone who believes in TA but it cannot be applied all the time.

Too much worry in the world about everything else going on and the hardships that people face on a daily have increased. 

Crypto's not gonna bounce and go to the moon until the stock market sorts itself out as well. So .. it's going to go up or down. Brilliant. My guess is that Bitcoin will bottom 50% higher than the bottom before the Covid bull run. I forget what it was but let's say that was 10k BTC.. so I think in this bear BTC will drop to 15k.

Furthermore.. if the last high was 70k.. I think the next bull will bring it up to 105k

Im trying to save 10k to put in at 15k. Them I'll sell it when it hits 100k ( not to be gready lol)

So in this scenario I buy .75 BTC and cash out with 75k profit. Feel free to check my math.

I'd like to see this hypothetical bottom happen in September. And my selling point be Jan 2023 Is this the same chart from previous months? Your TA forgot to include a potential recession. Forget the rsi, macs, fortune cookie and moving average.   Until it breaks the lower high on the htf she's going down. not gonna comment on TA reading or opinion for now.

The foundation is already solid.. Regardless of its founders and their motives  XLM is set to fly, as soon as crypto transactions become like the current point of sale transactions in the credit card world are now.

Edit:

It's the lightweight armour of the crypto world.. 

Doesn't tie you down and you can still outperform all others..in theory. Smoke weed, buy crypto, repeat. As an analysis I would say this will be another shitcoin that will just pump and dump People literally only use XLM to transfer money between exchanges cheaply.  Its an old ass project with little to no community.  So many Layer 1's out there building useful applications; Avalanche, Fantom, Solana, Luna, Elrond Doing TA on stuff like this is pretty useless. A single bad headline sends projects like these to 0 with little hope for recovery. Technical analysis is solely price pattern behaviour right?

So nothing. It‚Äôs a stable coin.  People have no reason to hold it. There is no TA that can be done.

4,Hot take: Technical Analysis doesn‚Äôt work,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/s9s6ds/hot_take_technical_analysis_doesnt_work/,"""

People drawing lines and zigzags with moving averages and seven day calendars, waiting for the stars to align so they could buy into ETH when mercury enters retrograde‚Ä¶ Why do you do this to yourself? You cannot predict the future Nostradamus, so make better decisions for a better time later. This is your only hope‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs not magic, the market builds itself on good projects really. If you look in retrospect, yes you can see pump and dumps, but in the long-run, only good ideas prevail. And the sooner you buy, the more you earn potentially. So instead of drawing pastel lines at graphs, go buy in some small projects, like Royal Falcons Club for example, and save yourself the embarrassment. 

Buying early has always been the way how people made it BIG. And I mean big big not just a few pumps into their portfolio. """,0,21,False," A good tech analysis is supposed to use historic and present data to deliver an educated analysis of what is currently happening in the market. A Prediction based on that data is still just a guess. In crypto these analyses are mostly hot air since BTC controls everything. When BTC is stable you can pay attention to the purpose and development of the project you want to buy into but no matter how bullish you become, BTC can shit on your dreams. Technical analysis is much more than what you have described it to be. Trend lines and moving averages are jus the tip of the iceberg. Technical analysis includes many different methodologies and tools such as  Elliot Wave Theory, Fibonacci Retracement, Bollinger Bands, Ichimoku Cloud, etc.

The technical analysis conducted by many YouTubers, and those presented in online news articles, also typically only use the most basic methods and tools. The technical analysis that investment banks, private equity funds, commodity traders, and those with a Bloomberg Terminal can conduct is much more sophisticated.

Your critique of  technical analysis not being magic  because in retrospect it only points out the obvious is a post hoc ergo proctor hoc argument . Without t technical analysis there is no way to prove that in retrospect  it is as useless as you suggest  it to be in predicting price movement.

Also it is important to note that technical analysis is not used to measure the quality of a project, it is only used to analyze price charts. Suggesting otherwise only creates more confusion of what technical analysis is. As such, the most important thing to probably know about technical analysis is that it is used primarily by traders to make  decisions on when to open or close a position. Traders are not hodlrs.   Investors on the other hand are hodlrs and care about the quality of a project and getting in early. Traders make their money  in crypto through price volatility while investors make their money from successful good crypto projects.",0.9481

(Serious answers only),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/s4dp74/the_first_trillionaire_will_come_from_crypto_is/,"Think about it, isn‚Äôt it technically possible? Let‚Äôs say in the very early stages of Bitcoin you managed to buy 20 million token, and let‚Äôs say you had the fortitude to not sell and watch it climb. Boom it hits 60,000 you have 1.6 trillion dollars. Could you even take it out? Would you be allowed to? Why hasn‚Äôt anyone done this? Or let‚Äôs say someway or some how Shib hits a dollar. And you had 2 trillion coins or whatever..If you held all your coins you‚Äôd technically be a Trillionaire. I believe some num-nut out there will become one through crypto some way some how. If not a regular investor than def a dev. Serious though can some one explain if it‚Äôs possible if not then why?",1,26,False," The question really is, can they HODL for that long?  I mean, there would 10‚Äôs if thousands who are millionaires today if they had held onto Bitcoin since ‚Äò09. So that‚Äôs the real question to ask. As far as shib or a coin like that trillions of coins, you‚Äôd have to look at what the marketcap would be at that point, I mean, in a hundred or 2 hundred years ‚Äúif‚Äù crypto is running strong and the total martketcap is in the quadrillion‚Äôs, maybe. But think about that for a minute. REALLY unlikely even if is able to sustain for a couple hundred years and the currency is transferred from one family member to another for generations. 

The odds are astronomical and very unlikely. Technically possible, sure.

But on your Bitcoin analogy - there will only ever be 21 million coins mined, and right now about 19 point something million are out on the market.

If one believes that Crypto is the future, there's no reason why the first Trillionaire won't come from crypto. He will, of course, actually have assets in many asset types. No

The first trillionaire will come from a tech company.

I was not an early investor into this project but I was sharing good technical patterns on VRA for about a month and that setup is between 2-3x returns now.

But VRA has printed a [gorgeous falling wedge and retest](https://www.tradingview.com/x/A4BZKQ0Q/) last night and into this morning. The retest is still ongoing, but its very very close. And a ton of volume came in to support this move, leading to its strength and validity.

And [VRA zoomed out](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Yw0DZvJp/) shows just how nicely the technical patterns have been set up the entire way. I also have some insider news on VRA that there are 2 Top exchange listings coming this quarter, this is not first hand knowledge but it is from a close source that I would put >95% confidence on.

When coins reach price discovery is when moves happen fast because sell orders are no longer stacked. Price discovery targets are $0.11, $0.125, $0.144. If VRA starts to make a parabolic move those targets will get destroyed, but the technical patterns show those as the next targets.",3,28,True, [removed] [removed],0.0

I don't mind to pay if there's a legit group

What I want in a group:

- decent community size.
- decent website
- a community page where people we can discuss their performance 

Thanks",13,32,False," Signals don't work. If someone could accurately predict the direction of the markets they are not going to be selling it for $49 a month via discord because they would not need to. They would just use the knowledge to make money and keep it as secret as possible. There is no legit group. Stop looking for an easy way out and start learning to read the market yourself if you want to make money shuffling numbers on a computer. It's a lot of hard work, and you'll probably lose money the first 1-2 years. If that's not for you go look for some other hard work you can do and get paid for. As a 10 year veteran in the crypto space, the best advice I can give is, ""Don't try to trade. DCA and hold."" Usually anyone who offers you TA, trading advice, etc. for free is going to eat your lunch, probably because they're just looking to pump their token. 
You might get lucky and make a few good trades, but it's much harder in a bear market. Now is the time to slowly accumulate with funds you can afford and wait for the bulls to come home. anybody that says they provide ""signals"", you do not want any part of. Plenty of good TA groups out there but they are hard to find. Traders Reality, Jayson Casper, and ive never done Chart Champions but ive heard good stuff about their learning content from some legit top traders. Just heard the guy that runs it is a douche. 

Ultimately, you want to learn TA and be part of a good group w top traders that you can learn from. But I can tell you that it's going to take a while to learn. And that tons of new people join every day looking for ""signals"" and the top traders in those groups are annoyed as hell w the rotating done of people looking for signals. 

If you join a group, go in w a growth mindset, post ur TA and ideas, show ur doing the work, and if ur in a good group vets will see ur not someone looking for signals that will be gone next week and they might help. 

There is no quick path to the top. People who say DCA is the only way,  or people who say to have diamond hands are idiots. Diamond hands is exactly what market makers want retail traders to have so they can sell into strength. 

If you are a long term investor, DCA is legit. Just invest a set amount every period u decide and totally forget about it. Diamond Hands is for morons

Becoming consistently profitable as a trader is hard as hell. This is an arena filled w the smartest people in the world. if it was easy, everyone would do it. And you will probably get REKT in the beginning. I did. And all of the top traders I know started their journey by getting REKT. I'm not a top trader. I'm not particularly smart. But w a lot of work I've become profitable. You just gotta have the desire to do the work to learn. just do copy trading from your favorite investor.
or join the alt coin group you invested in for any updates

entry signals arent accurate and most TA groups wont genuinely help you invest unless you join a rugpull group There is one called ‚Äúblue whale‚Äù I follow on fb and discord. He does provide signals with entry and exits. I‚Äôve been eyeing it for a while. He gives out some free signals to all and seems to be mostly
Spot on All of them can do TA, but then when you see them complaining about their laptop you know they don‚Äôt really do well with those TA üòù Want a strategy For futures trading? There is a proverb in Turkish, you can't make sex with someone else's dick.

Learn TA and make your own setups. Now should be the best time to buy and hold Bitcoin because it will soon come up to a standard rate which enough profits will be granted. I'm an app designer, if you want to Collab on creating something send a plan There's a TA tab in the r/cc discord. Check out chart champions, you Will learn to make TA yourself, everything from identifying support and resistance points, learn to read the order book (exocharts) through their custom templates, scalping strategies, cyphers, overall market structure. And their discord has an amazing crew. They do not provide signals, but everyone is sharing ideas All the time.

4,Guardian Token Announces Collaboration with Industry Leader Benzinga,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v7srpz/guardian_token_announces_collaboration_with/,"June 8th, 2022:

Guardian Token, the ERC20 token that powers guardianplatform.io, has announced a collaboration with industry leader Benzinga on the data analysis of an ongoing set of crypto and digital asset surveys.

Benzinga is a global powerhouse of approximately 25 million monthly readers and is a hub for actionable information on capital markets.  This collaboration with Guardian Token & guardianplatform.io will help to provide valid and relevant data points directly from real cryptocurrency and digital asset investors to the Guardian program management team.  This data will drive the ongoing and future development of guardianplatform.io to provide real world utility solutions to all investors for some of the biggest issues within the crypto and digital asset space, thus improving the overall user experience.

Guardianplatform.io recently launched as an MVP (minimum viable product) crypto and digital asset research and education platform.  Even in it's initial release state, the Guardian Platform is capable of competing with some of the most used research and education platforms in the space.  Here you can find up to the second token data, market news, top gainers & losers, in depth token data with links to official project channels, CEX & DEX information, and more.  However the similarities stop there.

Additional features within guardianplatform.io include the G-Hub, a community based directory where organizations and people within the crypto and digital asset space can collaborate, share, learn, find services, and make connections.  There are also partnerships with Scratch Engine (NFT Evalutation Tool) and Sharity (Crypto Charity Platform), and an affiliation with FEGex already in place.  Looking at ongoing and future development within the Guardian Platform, components such as Technical Analysis, BrainStem, SpyDr, Whale WatchR, BagTrax, Herald, Genalock, Risk Assessment, and Token Strength will be key aspects of this user-focused platform. These components will enter phased development cycles based on prioritization, and two (BrainStem and Technical Analysis) have already commenced.

The results will be a fully integrated SSO (single sign on) capable of managing all your crypto currency and digital asset research and education needs, thus making guardianplatform.io a true powerhouse tool for investors throughout all sectors of the crypto and digiatal asset space.

The current open survey on guardianplatform.io is focused on Crytpo Currency and Digital Assets.  Future surveys being developed are:

Q2 2022 - Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT's)

Q3 2022 - Gaming

Q3 2022 - Digital Identity & Security

If interested simply go to guardianplatform.io to take the surveys.  While there take a moment to see what this project is building.  A tool built by investors for investors is a powerful thing, and this collaboration with Benzinga will put the Guardian Token and guardianplatform.io over the top!",11,16,False," This Is Huge, Awesome News!

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",8,32,False," What's good here guys? I hope everyone had a pleasant weekend, and is ready for new victories so to say!! Me myself, I'm looking forward to finally be able to mint these Honeyland bees. Been part of the community for a while now, and excitement is huge ahead of the mint date, set to start on 1st for select users. Any projects having some events you are looking forward to this week? Well the week started with a sign of commodities' markets rebound - even though US is closed - crypto got the message and will close Monday with a big green candle;  
That's a good sign for the rest of the week, we're looking at a potential 20% upward move. It's been a great start because of the green charts, but I know we should not get fooled by this. For now, I'm looking into different cryptos and Nfts that are about to launch on Polygen. Been holding PGEN for these whitelist events. Hey everyone, 
When looking looking at new projects, what makes you want to move forward with it? What kind of research does everyone do?
Thanks! Hi, is Bitzoher.com is safe ?  
My father won 0.5BTC and was directed on this broker. They ask for a huge deposit (0.01BTC) in order to withdraw what we have on an other wallet (Binance in this case).  
  
I don't want to mess with so many money, and I've only mined ETH directly to sell it on Binance.

I have this when I try to withdraw https://imgur.com/vbmNYM2 Apperantly i got no karma . Boost me up Scotty I got opinons that matter. Loopringüíô I'm looking for the best exchange.

Disclaimer: Staking Ethereum may offer long-term investors a good way to earn rewards. However, like anything in the crypto world, there are risks, which include price volatility and technical issues. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Too nervous to use lido or rocket pool tbh This guy again huh. GLTA!!!!! Best of luck and I hope it works out well for you.

Personally though, I can't trust exchanges enough to leave my funds on there, even if that's costing me potential revenue. 

I'm happier knowing that everything is safely stored on my Ledger. GLTA, this positivity is refreshing aber all these FUD posts, I also bought more...

Raid to riches GLTA!!!! Hoping to buy 50 more ETH at rock-bottom prices in July, taking my ETH staking total to 200. GLTA!!! Earning 3.6% yield isn't great when ETH price drops 80% in less than a year. If I did my math right, at the current price of ethereum, you are making 18 dollars a day? That's not bad for passive income, I won't make nearly as much but I guess I'll take a look into staking. Can you elaborate on how that APR is created and warranted ? Not your keys, not your crypto. Absolutely tragic solution in trust and promises no matter what the % rewards. You are meant to hold your keys. You either run a node or you hodl your coins. Anything less is another hack or Celsius rug I down voted bc this isn't even ETH 2.0

It's just using coinbase.... 

Good luck tho.",0.973

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",13,29,False," . Charles Hoskinson just sounded the alarm from Washington that Bitcoin maxis are actively trying to legislate away proof of stake in favor of laws to help Bitcoin. This type of behavior is toxic and anathema to what Bitcoin was founded on. The solution is not to ban competition. Maxis are toxic for the entire asset class and should be named and shamed for this behavior. What is happening to alts right now is a direct result of this.

Link: https://youtu.be/gHOO_fP75aM?t=1295 if i short usdt with 20x leverage isnt it free money ? its guranteed that it wont go higher then 1 dollar but it will likely go lower I am pretty new to all of this so can someone explein why is literally everything going down? Hypothetically‚Ä¶.if one were to have their seed phrase/ keys stolen and viewed their crypto on-chain be washed through a series of privacy coins and mixers how does the government determine if this person was legitimately stolen from or if it was the owner of said crypto acting intentionally to avoid tax?

Atm, I like Honeyland, as it resembles COC, a game I truly enjoyed playing back in the day. Do tell if you have any suggestions I just read the information, there are many platforms to support #Luna back. What do people think about this? Billy Markus, Dogecoin DOGE co-founder, says LUNA 2.0 will show the world just how truly dumb crypto gamblers really are.‚Äô LUNA 2.0 will go live on May 27th, 2022. Given the recent UST de-peg & LUNA collapse, do you agree with BillyM2K that buying LUNA 2.0 is a dumb idea? [Idoru.capital](https://Idoru.capital).

I just don't get how all the f*cking alts are related to BTC and the supports can be broken in a click of a finger. For example ALGO and XRP were consolidating above a strong support and then pluff down she goes.

I think it's best to focus like 70% on fundamentals because the crypto market doesn't behave like the stock market.

Will there be a day where BTC is no longer like the NASDAQ or S&P500 indicator for the stock market? Will TOTAL2 (crypto market cap excluding BTC) be the new indicator for alts at some point?

I mean I have things to learn as well, like do a more spread out DCA or maybe take profits when there are a few bearish indicators, but I mean BTC is not like many other alts and if BTC goes to 0 other alts could easily take it's place.",2,9,False," I tend doing the opposite: trying to understand crypto, TA is worthless Eventually some alts will stop behaving like btc, but that is a long way away from now. 

It has to do with market sentiment, btc is seen as a relatively safe asset and if that dips significantly it means it's probably time to pull off some positions. 

And it is simple to conclude that due to its large market cap it is harder for it to fall by much, cintrary to most altcoins. 

Also check the stocks market as it does carry much weight in what happesn in the crypto sphere. 

And lastly check btc dominance, you will see that everytime the market crashes it goes up, proving that people consider btc the better place for their money to be during uncertain times. Most coins are still heavily tied to BTC's balls. Doesn't matter the leadership, project, vision, or support. If BTC crashes then they all crash harder.

One day they'll be able to stand on their own but it hasn't exactly happened quite yet.

Lastly, BTC is heavily manipulated so even BTC's technicals can be hit or miss. FUD, rules and regulations, rumors, inflation, economies. All of it affects BTC.

Best thing is to be prepared for both upside and downside and manage your risk by keeping it minimized. Do your own research and don't listen to some claimed prophet saying BTC will be $450,000 by Wednesday. For everyone who needs to hear this - technical analysis is bs. Have a great day.",0.9265

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",7,34,False," Any news on the Terra Luna jazz? Every time the weekly volume of bitcoin got really high, we eventually saw a reversal in the trend. This happened in Jan 2015, Dec 2018, Mar 2020, and May 2021. Does anybody think the high volume this week may lead to an uptrend soon? I have staked ada and ethereum 2. I feel like it‚Äôs the safest play right now. What does everyone else say? I'm currently earning 0.429 ETH per month, via staking 140 ETH @ 3.68% APR in ETH2 rewards. Stack (BTFD), stake and HODL ETH to riches!!! GLTA!!! go check IXFI crypto project is too cool. Zoom Session

Anyone wanna hop on a zoom session and breakdown some trades live? If so just shoot me a message if this isn‚Äôt allowed just delete üëçüèΩ Not sure if anybody has used this exchange, but long story short I was trying it out with small money over the past few months and was going well. Then I made a big profit and that became the problem. They don't tell you upfront that they want you to pay a 10% tax to transfer your money, or two different id verification that cost 3k/5k. Now I get to become homeless because I can't pay the taxes and move the money since I did not know any of this upfront with them and getting them to explain what the hell was going on was a nightmare, although that might be partly due to the language barrier. Yes some of this could be done better by me and I fucked it up and some of it was just shit timing as I lost my job and savings shortly after this entire event. Hope this can at least help someone else even if it is what kills me in the process.

Sorry that got long and turned into a rant but I needed to get that out there and off my chest yeah Taking long positions might be a good choice personally for me in my analysis and put a stop loss under the small consolidation(daily chart) Who are the current buyers of UST and why do they think the price will go up?

**From the very beginning: How cypherpunks invented and promoted Bitcoin**

Community-based practices had been crucial for cryptocurrencies even before the word ‚Äòcryptocurrency‚Äô itself was invented by Forbes staff reporters in 2011. Mysterious anonymous creator of [Bitcoin](https://getblock.io/nodes/btc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo), Satoshi Nakamoto, didn‚Äôt introduce his brainchild at a conference or during a YouTube stream.

Instead, he shared a whitepaper for digital gold ([*Bitcoin*](https://getblock.io/nodes/btc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)*: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*) with the subscribers of cypherpunks‚Äô listserv. It was a closed group of cryptography and applied math enthusiasts. Adam Back, inventor of Hashcash protocol, video games developer Hal Finney and anonymous ‚Äòe-money‚Äô creator Wei Dai are the most well-known of them.

It was Hal Finney who received the first Bitcoin transaction. In 2009-2010, these cypherpunks were the only people contacted directly by Satoshi Nakamoto. He had approved one of them, Gavin Andresen, as the first non-anonymous Bitcoin lead maintainer - and then left the community for good.

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",219,182,False," [removed] Can someone explain why everything is down? Hello, I‚Äôm a big fan of crypto and I have a big faith in the market. Im in my late 20s with steady income from my software engineering job. However, the only portfolio I have is 401k, I was thinking that I would withdraw half of my 401k (of course with including the withdrawal penalty..) and put it towards crypto and coins that I believe, and have potentially 2 assets. What do you guys think about this? [removed] BTT anyone? Got into the market in November thinking it was a great time to get started. Had that same feeling every day since LoL Hi API3 will retest $9.50 today during Bidens speech today, like last time [removed] likely to see bitcoin sub 20k if SPY drops another 10% today, followed by sub 10k if another red day in a row - just look at march 2020 and this war business is far greater risk. I'm holding Putin personally responsible for my ""Red"" portfolio! Imagine being a community manager without enough karma. That's my life. Help me get some guys. :D This is the time for passive income, only alt you should be accumulating should be one with good staking APY with less risk like ORE token.Dyor Derivatives vs proof of work. Which has more influence? What influence do each have? It would be so great if oracles like LINK, BAND, DIA could get that spark they need in order to flip trend. They are one of the projects in crypto with reasonable utility and I hope they find their foot in the next leg up. very nice very nice [removed] Has Meme season finally ended? Will Fundamentals and utility take way.   
Is the era of social media influence and hype halted by the precipice of  
 mass adoption coming.  I think we are still decades away from seeing   
the true potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I mean  
 life changing applications and possibilities are being developed right   
before our eyes. I'm excited to see who and what survives long term and   
plan to play the long game. I have never had the means or luck to risk a  
 meme token or micro cap, but a 10 or 20x would be so helpful in the   
mean time. I DCA bi weekly for the long term and slowly learned to trade  
 with small amounts on the side. I think after 3-5 years in crytpo,   
numerous losses, watching charts, following trend and patterns, staying   
up to date with news, reading white papers, and watching so many videos   
on YouTube they all became the same monotonous narrative of repetitive   
""not"" shilling  unbiased content, I'm ready to dabble a little more   
avidly of my own accord. I can see the trends repeating and it looks

4,TECHNICAL INFORMATION INFORMATION ABOUT LIGHT DEFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/qk8jo3/technical_information_information_about_light_defi/,"Token name: Light DeFi 

Token Symbol: LIGHT 

Token decimal places: 9 

Total supply: 10,000,000,000 

Light DeFi is a token generated by the smart contract 0x842668E2B9A73240aBF6532DEdC89c9c3e050C98 (the ‚ÄúSmart Contract‚Äù) and operated in the Binance Ecosystem.

The Light DeFi token has a maximum limit of 10,000,000,000 units and must be purchased through the Smart Contract indicated above upon payment made with another token that uses the BEP-20 protocol (there will be no payment in fiat currencies as the US Dollar or the Euro). The amount paid by the buyer (the ‚ÄúHolder‚Äù) in BNBs will be stored in the Pancake Swap, and the buyer will receive the equivalent amount in Light DeFi tokens. 

The sale process of the Light DeFi token by the Holder will follow the opposite path: the Light DeFi token units will be transferred by the Holder to the Smart Contract and, in exchange, the Holder will receive its value, at the time of the transaction, in BNBs or other cryptoassets (never in fiat currencies like the Dollar or the Euro). This buying and selling system, which constitutes the primary market, will operate under a transfer fee of 10% (the ‚ÄúTransfer Fee‚Äù), which will be explained below. It is important to emphasize that secondary commercialization (P2P) is also possible.",0,1,False,,0.0

The Terra network is a dual-network platform that‚Äôs home to both the [LUNA](https://swapzone.io/currencies/terra) token and the UST stablecoin family.

Terra has found itself in the spotlight among BTC investors due to the network‚Äôs plans to invest a whopping $10 billion in BTC to back its new USD stablecoin. Do Kwon, Terra co-founder, Tweeted, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not 10B today ‚Äì as UST money supply grows, a portion of the seigniorage will go to build BTC reserves bridged to the Terra chain.‚Äù

  Thank you in advance for your participation. Enjoy!",30,63,False," XTZ is pumping guys! Get on if u still can. $SHIB AND $DOGE üöÄ This week I am holding onto  my UST and playing the current market by exchanging cryptos that have had a good run, for cryptos with strong fundamentals and which are yet to join the rally. My  Main trade this week was exchanging 20% of my Luna for Juno. NO I am not partial to only cosmos projects, I do follow &hold DOT and Avax too, but Luna, Juno, Atom, Akash is where I see the max potential in coming months Anyone else worried about the lack of volume leading into this rally? **I spent 5 hours analyzing Goldfinch. Here are my findings.**  
Last weekend, I spent a big chunk of my Saturday doing a deep-dive blog post into Goldfinch. What I found:

* Unsecured lending (the problem Goldfinch is solving) is interesting, but Goldfinch's innovation is business model innovation, not technical innovation.
* Goldfinch lowers the risk of unsecured lending in 3 ways: 1) Business borrowers only; 2) On-chain human Auditors, and 3) Backers. The key is 1) Business borrowers.
* In other words, Goldfinch picks the least risky borrowers

Is this good or bad? 3 conclusions:

* Conclusion 1: Goldfinch acts as a middleman between different lending businesses. It is unlikely to revolutionize it.
* Conclusion 2: One can do a fundamental analysis of Goldfinch's value, based on the amount of outstanding loans and number of borrowers.
* Conclusion 3: If you are a yield-farmer, Goldfinch offers probably a more stable, easy-to-understand returns with lower risk than many DeFi projects out there. If you are looking to buy $GFI (the governance tokens), be wary of regulatory risk.

Full version of my analysis: https://www.dantehq.com/article/BDhj9\_KYH37wjuHMRYVOCs/lending-without-collateral-a-primer-for-goldfinch Check out this post for small cap gem picks. Easy profits over the next bulk cycle!
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/trw1vj/small_cap_kucoin_gems_to_plant_a_seed_in/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share I love to get some educated thoughts on eight coin at its current almost $14 price? I only recently became aware of it and I'm assuming I'm extremely far behind. As I usually am. Just wondering if it may be worth it to grab a small amount? I'm accumulating low-cap stocks because they have a lot of growth potential, and the market is showing some signs of life here and there. Last year, I made quite a fortune simply by holding TOWER, though I did lose holding some others but gained overall. I recently added some DKT, NII, MPL, and CVP to my bag in order to be well prepared for the next bull run. LRCüíô moon soon!! Shiba army ? The technicals provide some insights; it looks like 45600 is strong support for BTC, and if it does not break it in the near term, we can see a new high soon.

What is your thought on the technicals of the benchmark coin? Anyone wanna try a new cryptobot? I‚Äôve been consistently getting good return from it. Are we really entering a real alt pump or does bitcoin still need to fully correct before we go big? The TA says It needed to dip down to around 30k before heading to all time highs again. Love to hear your thoughts? Best TA books for beginners? Im balls deep in Cro and XRP with no exit strategy , I had a dream last night that one of my alt coins mooned and I earned ‚Ç¨1,357,388 as I began to login to cdc app to check which one I woke up.... Stellar XLM fans check out the sdexexplorer, it's like a coin market cap but for all the tokens on Stellar Network. Read the interesting write-up on why traders may be keeping tabs on BTC price movement. I'm quite sure every trader would be anticipating a climb in price of BTC from the 44.5k test zone in the coming days. Whether this would happen as expected in the coming days is still a big question however. Market influences on the asset haven't been quite distinctive lately. But then, the next one or two weeks could reveal a lot. Anyone's thoughts on evergrow?

BattleMechs on Android. Earn **Gemz** ([BattleMechs price today, GEMZ to USD live, marketcap and chart | CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/battlemechs/)) while playing the game. It is based on the Zilliqa blockchain [r/Zilliqa](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zilliqa/) ([Zilliqa price today, ZIL to USD live, marketcap and chart | CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zilliqa/))

Whitepaper: [https://whitepaper.battlemechs.co/](https://whitepaper.battlemechs.co/)

BattleMechs is a revolutionary play-to-earn blockchain game bridging the gap between mobile gaming and crypto. Via a custom build software development kit for the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/), BattleMechs creates a smooth user-experience akin to traditional mobile games.

BattleMechs has integrated with the [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/854415cf3d214371a7b60cf01ead0918) and [Zilliqa blockchain](https://zilliqa.com/). Upon starting the mobile app players are automatically generated a Zilliqa and Ethereum wallet. There are no requirements to use additional blockchain wallets and or extentions such as Metamask or Trust Wallet.

Having all blockchain related wallets and transactions directly managed from within the BattleMechs app allows for a traditional mobile gaming experience, in addition to making the process of interacting with the blockchain a lot more approachable for non-technical users. Powered by [BLOX-SDK.com](https://blox-sdk.com/) .

üì∑ Earn rare NFT loot and $GEMZ by mining

Powered by **Zilliqa** and BLOX-SDK

It's on Google play store currently, not available on iOS as of yet.

**If you use my code**: **Memz** you get free 10 GEMZ in-game, here it is: [BattleMechs](https://battlemechs.co/referral?code=memz)

Edit: It is currently still in development, but the game allows you to mine ever 6 hours and everytime you complete it, you earn 2 Gemz. Which equals to $1.30 every 6 hours of mining. Which I think is amazing. So potentially you're looking at $5 daily earning without even doing anything.

I think this year is for bears and next year maybe we can talk about ‚Äûlight‚Äú version of bull It would be nice for it to be true, but I think we'll continue a bearish/sideways trend for another 6-9 months before we see the beginnings of a bull run. This has only just begun. Get back at me after we take the bounce around 14k (300 ma) or 20k (200 ma). Trade safe. Trust me bro Hahaha. No way, any run is just a bear trap man. This hasn't even come close to the bottom yet. Eoy best to start recovering. The economy is in shambles and inflation is the new norm, gas just went up thirty cents yesterday and the housing market is not sustainable...and yes who can forget there's a war going on that could turn into nuke city... it should have happened months ago this crash. üòÇ Marking your words don't think you can reliably predict a macro reversal on a 1h chart. though this does signify that at least a short-term bounce can be expected here. while there's a chance the bounce could turn into a reversal, that's just unfounded hopium unless you pair it with some other longer-timeframe factors Yes, it will ultimately but it will take a while. The repair to this brutal damage to the market structure will take a while I don‚Äôt think so but I do think bitcoin will recover to 40k again this year. Against all odds i am with you. Thinking things will recover faster and bigger than most expect And who the fuck are you? May 24/25

That's when all the shorts come due.

You're insane if you think there's a Bull run before those numbers come out.

This isn't hard man.
Just look at ANY defi trading platform.

None of them have the letter L after them, but there's a whooooole bunch with 3s after the symbol.

6,"Bull market incoming, mark my words",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/uo8qc4,,2,31,False," Crypto is forming the suck my balls pattern at the moment. Dead cat. I think this year is for bears and next year maybe we can talk about ‚Äûlight‚Äú version of bull It would be nice for it to be true, but I think we'll continue a bearish/sideways trend for another 6-9 months before we see the beginnings of a bull run. This has only just begun. Get back at me after we take the bounce around 14k (300 ma) or 20k (200 ma). Trade safe. Trust me bro Hahaha. No way, any run is just a bear trap man. This hasn't even come close to the bottom yet. Eoy best to start recovering. The economy is in shambles and inflation is the new norm, gas just went up thirty cents yesterday and the housing market is not sustainable...and yes who can forget there's a war going on that could turn into nuke city... it should have happened months ago this crash. üòÇ Marking your words don't think you can reliably predict a macro reversal on a 1h chart. though this does signify that at least a short-term bounce can be expected here. while there's a chance the bounce could turn into a reversal, that's just unfounded hopium unless you pair it with some other longer-timeframe factors Yes, it will ultimately but it will take a while. The repair to this brutal damage to the market structure will take a while I don‚Äôt think so but I do think bitcoin will recover to 40k again this year. Against all odds i am with you. Thinking things will recover faster and bigger than most expect And who the fuck are you? May 24/25

That's when all the shorts come due.

You're insane if you think there's a Bull run before those numbers come out.

This isn't hard man.
Just look at ANY defi trading platform.
What are the top 5 positions???

None of them have the letter L after them, but there's a whooooole bunch with 3s after the symbol.

Yes, BNB3L is at 853%, but that's the ONLY one, and that's because it's not ETH related.

7,What do you think is the best crypto exchange right now and why?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v1p135/what_do_you_think_is_the_best_crypto_exchange/,"If you've been following cryptocurrencies for a while, you'll notice that most of us don't pay much attention to exchanges other than the ones we use on a regular basis.

This piqued my curiosity because the interactions and expenses of my present transactions are increasing.

I currently use Kucoin, bitvavo, and binance.

However, as I read on several crypto subs. I became interested in trying [Gemini](https://twitter.com/Gemini) because they offer crypto learning tools and a wide variety of supported cryptocurrencies. I also came across AAX and became intrigued when I read their [blog](https://blog.aax.com/en/2022/05/31/aax-unveils-aaxcel-to-enable-crypto-community-to-vote-for-its-preferred-projects/), hoping to contribute and join their community to vote for my favorite crypto projects.

Is it a good idea to try a different exchange this time?While we have considered only a few platforms that exist on the market, what platforms do you already use among mentioned or just planning to try?",145,78,False," Kraken is leaps and bounds above everything else out there IMO. Binance U.S doesn't offer enough coins, It's coinbase for me Gemini, Coinbase, voyager, or kraken Kraken: Great rates, clear KYC requirement levels, able to manage large transactions without senseless freezing of assets, excellent customer support. Using Binance and Coinbase for now. Gemini for swing trades because of their low fees

Crypto.com for hodling because their earn program is pretty solid. Try AAX and Gemini first, and then determine if it works well for you.  
I feel that selecting a cryptocurrency wallet is primarily determined by your preferences and goals. IMO, Coinbase and Binance are pretty safe. I use Kucoin and Binance but i recognize that lots of improvements is needed to improve CEX and DEX platforms as a whole which is where FLUID liquidity will potentially come in with tighter regulations, solving the problem of price disparity among these exchanges and more. FTX!!! Everything is clear to me: it's Hitbtc and Coinbase. Neither exchange did anything that would make me nervous. I bought the necessary coins quite easily when one or another of them offered an acceptable rate for me.  I trade on Kraken, Binance, and CDC.  
  
CDC primarily for the card and Binance for BSC, but Kraken is my preferred exchange.  
  
To be honest, I don't use all of the functions in each transaction. In my point of view, Binance would be best but if you are living in Canada, you may try Netcoins. It's great because you can make instant trades, set limit orders and measure your portfolio balance all in one spot. That's how I started though. Now, they've recently launched 9 new coins that you can check out. [https://netcoins.ca/](https://netcoins.ca/) NDAX, Newton, or Netcoins if you're based in Canada. But, the best for me is the third one. Netcoins Nexo, BlockFi, and Gemini are my particular favorites. I initially signed up for the incentive, but after seeing the good savings rates, I began using the apps more frequently. Nexo is something I'm considering using more of in order to take advantage of its lending option.  I use CDC for staking. They have a wide selection and offer decent rewards. I like KuCoin If you are talking about CEX, people love Kraken, their support is really good 

But personally i prefer to use Binance as it has more tokens that I use like Kadena, and recently Algorand though i think Kraken has that already

They also have more cash if something happens :p Bittrex is my preferred exchange for my HBAR purchases. All the other exchanges have been a hassle to deal with on different occasions. Bittrex has been very consistent in my honest opinion!!! There are many options, and all of them are good in general, but of course, every exchange has its pros and cons. I‚Äôve used many exchanges, but the main one right now is Netcoins.

Netcoins is my best choice for buying and holding, I buy coins and leave them until there‚Äôs a significant amount to withdraw to my hardware wallet. They also have a crypto academy [https://netcoins.ca/crypto-academy/](https://netcoins.ca/crypto-academy/) where you can learn all the basic fundamentals you should know about cryptocurrency and blockchain. I'm currently utilizing Bitpanda as a broker, however the fees are extremely high. Is there a similar (easy-to-use) broker accessible in Europe with lower fees? In what country? Has anyone had any experience with Unizen? Trading functionality includes market or limit orders and stops. On top of that, you can trade on 3x margin too. I like Gemini for the free withdrawals. Up to 10 a month I think. I use many exchanges depending on what I'm trading but my favourite is Binance. Bitpanda.. Kraken, very security conscious, and they have a decent selection that's growing.

A close second is [coinbase pro](https://pro.coinbase.com), only because coinbase pro fees are the same as [crypto.com](https://crypto.com)'s, and instant deposit. Coinbase pro is like a weird emergency on ramp. Em....It seems there is a [crypto exchange ranking](https://www.coincarp.com/exchanges/) by the third party. Some are good for some countries, but not working well in some countries. Also, some tokens are only available in certain exchanges, so, nothing is 100% best. for me personally, best exchange is the one which provides AVERAGE PURCHASED COST for each coins in my portfolios. n so far I haven't found any BUT only ONE... Although, Raiilgun's private DEX is not live yet. I'm actually looking forward to it. It's going to be really interesting to make trades privately and anonymously. I'm beginning to realize the how compromised security is with the public nature of the blockchain. Although, a demo is out which I'm already trying. I expect to use it more when it is fully operational Well, if it's related to CEX I would say Binance, they have the most volume there. If you are looking to DEX then Quickswap is fast and cheap. I know Kaddex will launch in June usually and it will be a fast and cheap pow DEX on Kadena. Kucoin is the best imo. Love its security feature & also no compulsory KYC like Binance. 

I'm however looking forward to the FLUID platform launch; liquidity aggregator where you can make trades at best execution, low-latency & low fees. I've been using Netcoin and it's the best for buying and holding, especially on BTC. but somehow I used to learn more about crypto, Blockchain on this platform that's why I love using this thing. Check it out if you're in Canada [https://netcoins.ca](https://netcoins.ca) I think it's the Phemex Celery can be found on smartBCH. It works similarly to HEX in that you stake tokens and earn income. The interest rate is 100% APY and will double every year! If you're interested, they also have a Telegram group. It's a cryptocurrency annuity that can easily replace your savings account. Staking SCLP for 4 years also guarantees you an APY of more than 75%. You can also claim the incentives on a daily basis. You get your money back in about a year, and everything else is profit. And Scallop is only getting started - the token's value will only rise. In my opinion, this is a fantastic deal! Phemex offers over 75% APY for every staked coins I like OKCoin and kraken. I use Crypto.com on occasion but only if none of the other exchanges offer any said coin. I have KuCoin as well and would love Binance, but unfortunately I‚Äôm in the US. Why don‚Äôt you figure out how to use Uniswap and quick swap and you are almost done Binance will fuck with your property whenever they feel like. They also mess with futures and pass your info about stoplosses and whatever to whales. Anything on crypto.com or FTX? I think Phemex is one of the best at this time 
It's high transaction processing speed and the cold wallet security is a reason fore picking it over other exchanges",0.9997
7,South Korean top 5 exchanges have announced the end of transaction support for Litecoin (LTC),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v7lot5/south_korean_top_5_exchanges_have_announced_the/,"Including Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax. The reason for termination is the MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB) network upgrade carried out by [Litecoin (LTC)](https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/litecoin/) and as it was judged that anonymous transmission technology was added.",73,75,False," Litecoin [pros](/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v7lot5/south_korean_top_5_exchanges_have_announced_the/ibl9qk7/) & [cons](/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v7lot5/south_korean_top_5_exchanges_have_announced_the/ibl9qtb/) and related info are in the collapsed comments below. Pros and cons will change for every new post. MimbleWimble Extension Blocks sounds like something out of a children‚Äôs book Monero and Firo are of similar plight in the US CEX, but I believe it has a place to those folks that embrace privacy in a good way especially to those countries that are oppressive.
Politicians and regulators misunderstood what privacy is in cryptocurrency; it is just the same as anonymous cash tendered on a store. But the irony is - privacy crypto are often viewed being used for shady activities by the hackers in a ransom situation; and that reputation is being magnified by the regulators. So unfortunate.. if only most folks look into the privacy features of these coins, it actually benefits us all. I currently only have a Bitcoin node on my server. Guess I'll set up a Litecoin node too. XMR Did they bank Luna after it crashed the market? Gonna add south Korea to my shithole list then

It's really a shame that there's so much pressure against privacy and encryption

In a democracy where the rulers are choosen by the people there shouldn't be this working against each other. And more of we work together

Most shitholes just say we want to do something against CSAM so fuck everyone's privacy.
And since basically everyone agrees that child abuse is horrible one can easily fall for that stuff What does that mean for ltc ? Is it time.to sell? that‚Äôs so disappointing. Another crypto going to get murder. Bringing the total marketcap of crypto even lower. bad news! Luna already murdered us Looks like we're headed into a dual system of, a formal non privacy coin system and a full privacy coin system, running in parallel. This was incredibly shortsighted on their part, as they don‚Äôt have to have Mimblewimble available on the exchange. This is like being mad that Bitcoin can go through tumblers and delisting it‚Ä¶",-0.9934
7,South Korean Crypto Exchanges Are Ready To Delist Litecoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v7qwzb/south_korean_crypto_exchanges_are_ready_to_delist/,"""All five of South Korea‚Äôs licensed, fiat-trading crypto exchanges have announced they will delist [Litecoin (LTC)](https://swapzone.io/currencies/litecoin)  after developers rolled out the Mimblewimble Extension Block protocol"". 

According to Cryptonews.com Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax decided to delist LTC. It's the first time for the South Korean crypto industry that all major exchangers made such a decision. 

In Upbit‚Äôs statement, which was similar to those of its rivals, the exchange said that transaction support would last until June 20, with withdrawals allowed until July 20. 

Last month, the protocol, which allows users of the Litecoin network to choose whether or not to make their transactions confidential, was presented. According to exchanges this update broke South Korean law which forbids exchanges from listing such tokens, insisting that all transactions be screened for possible money laundering violations.

Is it the end for LTC?

Pros and cons will change for every new post. Government hates privacy, it's why Monero is delisted on most exchanges but it's still in demand.

Litecoin without a privacy feature was ok but now that they have added mimblewimble (which isn't as good as Monero), they decided to delist it üôÉ. I always liked Litecoin for the utility and low transfer fees.  I used LC most for actually purchasing goods. This should actually be a reason to buy litecoin.
But I doubt the majority thinks like that. How dare people have privacy! XMR is the way. There is still room for growth in the privacy crypto sector. This is great news. Gives the old school LTC folks something to grasp onto. This is fantastic news for the Litecoin community. Delisting proves that this latest development functions well and also shows any exchange that delists are against privacy for its users.

Most bullish news for Litecoin in a long time. Well done Charlie and crew! My guess is buy the dip caused by initial sell off, any extra functionality that is also a choice is bullish Bullish as all fook! Major cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea have delisted Litecoin ( LTC ) weeks after flagging its privacy-focused MimbleWimble (MWEB) upgrade. Lol.  No. This will probably also hurt Dogecoin, since it relies so heavily on auxpow secured mostly by the litecoin miners. Well damn, seems like they are really feisty over there. Don't have a problem woth litecoin, convert my CCD sometimes to when i want to make a transaction Have Korean banks not been involved in money laundering of the won before ? More for us The MetaGods is Worth investing. I'd like to know how many people there use crypto exchanges like BFX Really, how about SOL? ü§î well, I  sure hope they include PGEN in the listing.. it's much better. Especially now that holders are given the chance to join tiers.

Nothing more to see here. Just some more blood to be spilled. Off you go, and we‚Äôll do this again in 2026. 

If we‚Äôre still here. You can just put all your money in crypto

aaaaand it's gone. they aren't going anywhere, it's the time to buy COIN as it touches 30-50 range and it's got plenty of cash on had. if anything, they need to scale back some of their hiring rates and what they afford talent. Coinbase is terrible as a company but everyone had better pray that it does not go bankrupt - should that occur, btc will flash crash to about $15k or less. Sounds great if you want to buy, but the whole sector will collapse as a result and take many many years to recover. FUD If Coinbase is at risk of default, there are likely other exchanges that are as well. Is anyone familiar with other exchanges that do not include this type of bankruptcy language in their user agreement? What about if you have Fiat on coinbase? Primary pillar of Bitcoin is the ability to self custody.  You no longer need a bank or other trusted 3rd party to manage your money.  It is not that difficult. Take a few minutes to learn and you will see just how easy it can be. Monero & Not Your Keys

Is there a more iconic duo? I just pulled all crypto from 3 exchanges to a hardware wallet, apart from 4$ of DOGE.

Do the same before you lose your investments! Sick, so everyone who staked eth through Coinbase is fucked. I‚Äôm guessing if CB goes under majority of exchanges will as well, and ultimately crypto as a whole would. Can‚Äôt the person just transfer it to a cold wallet? Only in us or in general - in other countries too? So ummmmm asking for a friend but what‚Äôs the latest and greatest on cold wallets these day ? their app sucks This was the time that uses should be careful and alarmed with related to crypto So if Voyager goes bankrupt our USDC gaining 9% yield can go poof?... Nowadays it's quite easy to lose usdt in different ways And normies just left the building on crypto Which coin wallet is best? No shit Sherlock. Wow the FUD haha.. Coinbase isn't going anywhere Ideal and leave only the essentials at the brokerage. In that case exchange owns your crypto and can do with it everything they want. I think its better to buy crypto on instant buy platforms like simpleswap where you own your crypto not an exchange. Best to get out of Coinbase.
Of course every exchange is always at risk. This is why you should only trust Kraken Well I was just in time that I withdrew all of my assets to a more reputable company called wealthsimple I feel a fool for staking eth 2.  My stomachs is turmoil and I now know better, geee maybe this is why everyone left Coinbase? Out of spite for the stake of infinity",0.9782

Thats the name of the game, an exchange is not a bank. You cant have 20% APY on one hand and then complain when theres no reimbursment. Its the wild west man, and we all knew it. I have friends who bought luna on coinhako. After the crash, the exchange placed a notice asking crypto buyers to be wary of volatility when attempting to buy luna & disabled the buy button BUT leaving the option to sell on. To add salt to injury, the following week, they gave luna holders till 25th May 2359h to move the tokens to external wallet or face forced liquidations back to fiat. They were kind enough to wave the transfer fee thou.... I‚Äôd delist shit too. jeez sounds a lot like the way most hedge funds operate...and those are \*regulated\* by the SEC apparently This is why I'm incredibly bullish on dexes long term. The more these things happen, the more people realize ""not your keys, not your coins"". And embrace use of amm dexes instead which connects with your wallet, giving you complete control over your funds. Might be worth it investing in very undervalued ones, but in a chain that will survive either way. Like greenhousedex on polygon, buttonswap on secret network. Key is the undervalued nature. Some dext tokens got valuations very well inflated. Not your keys, not your coins.  


They chose to because they could, you are not the customer but the product. Still can't believe that many people have lost their usdt Crypto exchanges just want to make money on maker and taker fees.

Whales have been moving to cold storage. Now some folks are panicking. Nothing special So isn't the problem here that the very thing that caused the major crypto currencies to boom over the past few years is exactly what is going to make this a long and painful ride to the bottom?

Institutional money makes up a shit ton of the economy and those guys aren't buying into the ""digital gold"" nonsense, crypto is volatile and in a bear market or recession they offload volatile investments.

If (when) they really start tightening the taps crypto has a long way to fall. \*Anyone that has a few millions can crush the market easily let alone billionaires\*  
1. You coordinate shorts with a few millionaires, keep chain-shorting every peak, bounce or retracement

4. Buy back on the liquidations of the retail investors.

Pros and cons will change for every new post. I've seen these posts from 60k all the way down to 30k If Bitcoin is moving off of exchanges, isn‚Äôt this bullish? Pretty hard to sell Bitcoin from a wallet >Because in recent days, data shows that approximately $ 1.8 billion in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether assets came out of the exchanges. 

The article/headline is misleading.  They're including stablecoins like USDT as if they're ""BTC outflows"" which seems stupid and inaccurate.

Nowhere are there any sources for the data, and they don't differentiate how much is each crypto.

They also don't state which exchanges this data comes from.

This is a great example of a story without any actual details and is just someone's opinion. Everything is in place on the supply side of Bitcoin with less and less BTC available on the exchange platforms. However, for the price of Bitcoin to take off, we need to have a spark in the spot market. That spark is the demand that is struggling to take off.

The price will move to a new ATH as soon as that spark arrives. There are three methods of gaining wealth from Bitcoin.  Each method corresponds to an era in Bitcoins maturity.  The first method is quick, the second method is short, and the third method is long.

The first method is to mine it when the difficulty is low enough that CPUs can be used, or to buy it from miners when the price is nothing or close to it.  You might think we're well beyond this right now but it could happen again if the price crashes to zero.

The second method is to trade it on exchanges, taking advantage of high liquidity and volatility to acquire more while reducing one's effective cost per coin.  This is what most people have been doing for the last ten years and may continue to do for many years more. But for every dollar gained a dollar was lost, and all of the people who've lost money to trading crypto have no intention of repeating the same mistake.  The lack of demand has reduced both the liquidity and volatility of the market, forcing us to transition to the third method.

The third method is to buy and hold.  Save your fiat over time and when the price of Bitcoin drops unusually low you buy it and hold it in a safe place, like a cold wallet.  This is the long game and it just began in early 22, after the crash in the fall of 21.

The government is using the recent happening around Luna as a means to target crypto exchanges for regulations but that won't be true decentralization I guess.

Trust wallet coinomi and c98 are multi-chain, and c98 you can connect to DEX‚Äôs ie pancakeswap uniswap from within the wallet. As for other exchanges, depends on where you are and what you‚Äôre holding. Gemini I also use binance mainly because it‚Äôs home to some of the most promising low caps like DVDX and UBXT. 
EGLD is also great because of its speed. It can perform over 70k TPS A hardware wallet for sure. As for exchanges I personally like DEX's. Quickswap and Uniswap on Polygon would be good options for cheap transactions. The main option for me are decentralized exchanges. And there they are a lot. My favorites in this regard are wowswap, dydx. You can take a look at them inside I would rather make use of DEXes so I don't relinquish the control of my assets to some CEXes, with DVDX offering zero slippage and unlimited liquidity that could be the way to go. Actually, my long term plan is to keep a private wallet and balances on Railgun once it goes live this month. First thing is that I'm done with CEX.

7,Keep your coins off centralized exchanges,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/swb0zy/keep_your_coins_off_centralized_exchanges/,"
Seriously, I can't stress this enough, more and more countries are making cryptocurrency related rules, your coins at risk of being locked away or confiscated from you, all from a single law. Centralized exchanges are forced to comply with these rules, you could lose all your crypto in any time.


 You may be wondering where do I put my coins in. What's the alternative to centralized exchanges you may ask. The answer is simple. You need to have a crypto wallet to store your coins.There are some apps on android, IOS, windows and others, make sure your DYOR to get the right one. As the saying goes : ""Not your keys, not your coins"". And even better, store it in a hardware wallet if you have a large sum of money in crypto. And then you have to try decentralized finance or DeFi for short. You can look into the well known ones like Aggregated Finance, PankakeSwap or Aave. 



In conclusion, not your keys not your coins, so store your coins on hard wallets and try out DeFi instead of using centralized exchanges.",48,29,False," It's the safest way by far. Has an exchange ever locked up a bunch of accounts because of a new law? Usually and from my own experience the exchanges give you a far enough warning that there is a new law and you will either need to close a position or move your coins.

Edit: just read that the Canadian gov is requesting a lock up of accounts. So I guess if you plan on fighting your government probably best not to use a CEX No. 

The majority of users aren‚Äôt tech savvy enough to be using most of the dexs. Having to swap your money around four times just to get a coin that will pair with the one you want is a headache most aren‚Äôt going to want to have. This whole ""nOt uR kEyS nOt Ur cRyPto"" thing is an old dumb narrative. 

Years ago, when Bitcoin was tough to buy there were sketchy exchanges. That is why people say this. Today if you are using a shitty weird exchange you are an idiot. There are so many established ones out there right now. The security features are more what any bank I have ever had gives out. People who are new to crypto need to feel comfortable with this or else there will never be major adoption. To scare new people even more gives crypto a tougher hill to climb. You got a way better chance of you ledger getting lost or broken than Coinbase getting hacked. Stop spreading FUD..the accounts were limited to certain groups in Canada and not all.. I‚Äôm always ready to push the sell button at any given point any given day. So no Perhaps this is a good idea. You can keep some of them in CEXs of course, but not all. Also new DEXs like glimmerswap emerging with super-cheap transaction fees would probably solve the problem of high cost of transactions. So, yeah. I think I agree. I‚Äôm not sure the answer is simple for everyone. most people aren‚Äôt custodians of their own money. Exchanges provide an easy means of transaction. That said, probably not a bad idea to have a cold storage wallet in your possession should you need to withdraw. Better still, try out privacy protocols that offer the options for private balance. 

OP is right, Having your coins on a CEX in an unpredictable time like this is not the best. 

I know Railgun is bringing privacy into DeFi. Privacy and DeFi together sound like the perfect ingredients to keep your wallets out of risk. That's right, DeFi is the best thing to explore right now. Unfortunately, many people don't even know where and how to get started. I'm well familiar with Aave and Curve and it's super dope for those who know how to play the game well. But for those who don't, better to stay in the queue in wait for Spool. From what it is pitched to do, it automatically routes deposits through yield generating protocols and compounds deposits accordingly. In any case, DeFi is still the direction to turn to. There are pros and cons to centralised and decentralised exchanges, which is the basis for our company Quantex. We allow people to choose whether or not they keep custody of their funds by simply using our swap platform, or they can choose to store their funds on our exchange by using our trading platform (coming soon). Yep. Be aware of CEXs. Not every one of them can be fully trusted. To be honest, if you really have a lot in crypto, just get a ledger. I have all my BTC, ETH, Ocean Protocol and eMoney NGM there.",0.9966

7,Will the space potentially shift away from PoW Chains in exchange for eco-friendly alternatives ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/tbumim/will_the_space_potentially_shift_away_from_pow/,"I saw an article yesterday on Cointelegraph on how the HBAR Foundation launched a $100M climate-focused impact fund which they gave away to DOVU which is a Welsh blockchain company.

DOVU uses Hedera to inexpensively issue tokenized carbon credits to any person, business, or government, in order to fund projects which remove, capture, or sequester carbon from the environment. 

Now here's what I'm thinking.   
Google, LG, IBM and major companies are backing Hedera, with crazy amounts too, and with everything going on in addition to ETH hopefully switching to a PoS eco-friendly environment, not to mention ETH is backed by Amazon, Microsoft, AWS, Google as well.

I believe so, the whole world is kneeling to the pressure of climate change and honestly it's way overdue.  


I'm glad to see that there are more networks opting for PoS instead of PoW and more entities like HBAR Foundation pouring funds into sustainable development which hopefully will be successful in making it the norm so that, we as a space, could all contribute and do our part in lessening the burden on the environment. Its not a matter of climate change anymore, its more about the fact that blockchain is really inefficient when it comes to mainstream retail.

With Hederas technology and HBAR foundation‚Äôs help, HBAR will slowly but surely top inefficient projects like Ethereum It's already happening.",0.939

7,Why do you have to fill in the price when buying and selling on an exchange?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/tc7w3z/why_do_you_have_to_fill_in_the_price_when_buying/,"I'm still new to this but I've been trying to feel my way around different interfaces, and something took me back a little bit. On Binance, when trading, you have to put in the price you want to buy a certain coin at. I don't understand this, when for instance, you can do the same thing by converting it on another page, and then converting it back when the price has gone up to make a profit.

But, if the coin already has a price, then why does it ask you to put in a price you want to buy at? Maybe all the courses I'm watching are bunk because none of them have mentioned this, or the reason behind it. It's the same for selling, you have to type in the price you want to sell at.

Even then I'm still a bit confused. Because there's the price you want to buy at, the fiat you're buying with, a slider at the bottom that has 1x, 2x, etc, and then a total. After only dealing with the convert page, I feel like I need to go back to school here.

Edit: Also I don't know what the flair should be for this.",3,17,False," I do not use Binance, but there are normally two ways to trade; limit and market. The first you set a price to purchase or sell and have to wait for an order to be matched. The latter will buy at the current available price until the total order value is filled. Depending on the size of the order, this can range in prices. You will see spikes happen on charts from where a large volume happens on a market order to purchase or sell as it works through the order book to fill. Because you might want to set a limit order. If ETH is $2.5k today, you may want to set a buy at $2.3k and see if it hits. Or the opposite if you have ETH already you might want to limit sell at $2.7k.

Your order goes into the order book and fills if the price gets there.

When I was new to Binance, I just used market buys as I was trading small amounts and I wanted to trade immediately If you can read charts or expect a drop to some price you can have a bot buy it for you when it hits that price so 6ou don't have to watch candles all day",0.4215

7,"The exchange you use, ends up using you",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/sqrd1l/the_exchange_you_use_ends_up_using_you/,"The idea behind exchanges is so simple and easy yet many people don‚Äôt understand what it means, to use a bank, an exchange or a platform. 

An exchange holds a massive amount of different tokens and allows you to buy and sell on your platform, for a small commission or fee. This means that, every time you buy or sell anything on an exchange, you hand off a small piece of your money. Nothing wrong with that in essence, but keep in mind, that the beast you feed is getting bigger.

When you use an exchange, you are making it more powerful and stronger. Every time you trade, you are giving them a little nudge forwards. This is important to know and understand, because if you like the exchange you use, you are making it bigger, but if you don‚Äôt, you are working against yourself. 

This is why I often sh*t on people who say for example, ‚Äòoh I don‚Äôt like Coinbase‚Äô or whatever exchange X, well then stop using that! Why do you have to put yourself through this? Use something better, or at least, experiment with different ones. I had gotten sick of Kraken until I tried a few others like Werewolf and some other DeFi platforms, and I like the latter already.

Since they're building a DeX with super-cheap gas fees I agree.

Avoid exchanges as much as you can, personally I recommend holding the keys to all your crypto at all times then when you want to trade between them use an instant exchange.

I even created a site: [OrangeFren.com](https://orangefren.com/) to compare the rates on instant, KYC-free, exchanges.

Dubai‚Äôs Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority has licensed two cryptocurrency exchanges: Binance and FTX. The regulator was formed last week when Dubai approved its first law to regulate crypto assets.

Cryptocurrency exchanges FTX and Binance have been licensed by Dubai‚Äôs Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA). The regulator was established last week when the first law to regulate crypto assets was adopted in Dubai.

Binance announced Wednesday:

We have been granted a virtual asset license from Dubai‚Äôs Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA).

With this license, ‚ÄúBinance will be able to operate within Dubai‚Äôs ‚Äòtest-adapt-scale‚Äô virtual asset market model as a base for expansion into the region,‚Äù the company explained.

‚ÄúAll licensed VARA service providers will be monitored progressively to open access to the retail market,‚Äù Binance noted, adding that in the future, it ‚Äúwill be permitted to extend limited exchange products and services to pre-qualified investors and professional financial service providers.‚Äù

In the future, I feel that more crypto trading platforms like Coinbase, Tycoon and Crypto.com will also get their licenses. 

Binance further revealed:

In addition to exchange operations, Binance will anchor a blockchain technology hub in the Dubai World Trade Centre.",35,2,False," Congratulations Binance, crypto adoption is picking up steam; in other news, the Portuguese central bank has granted Utrust a virtual asset provider license.",0.8126

7,Is Tether's decreasing market cap cause for concern?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/uq9pwf/is_tethers_decreasing_market_cap_cause_for_concern/,"Speculation and possible FUD post. Please share your thoughts.

Let‚Äôs say a bad acting large institution wants to de-peg tether. How could they do it? I think we all probably correctly assume Tether doesn‚Äôt have enough dollars or cash equivalents backing it.

Big institution could buy or borrow 10 billion USDT. Sell it. Cause panic selling that turns into a death spiral? Is this possible?

Let‚Äôs say the big institution successfully causes the panic selling. Then BTC falls to from $30k to $10k. Big institution buys 10 billion dollars of BTC (1 million BTC). Then they pump BTC to $100k. Now big institution has a 100 billion dollar BTC portfolio. 10 billion was flushed down the toilet. Another 10 billion invested. They made 80 billion in profit. (If they could even sell 1 million BTC)

The charts for UST (Terra Luna‚Äôs stable coin) and USDT (Tether) are looking eerily similar.

UST (Terra Luna former stable coin) 7 day market cap (initial drop \~ 22% in 6 hours)

USDT (Tether) 7 day market cap (9% drop in a little over 3 days). Looks like multiple large sells may be staggered here. Institutional de-risking or the start of something nefarious?

It doesn‚Äôt appear USDT has ever had more than \~ 3% dip in market cap. We are currently triple (9%) that drop.

The price of USDT is also looking shakier than it has in the last year. You can see it still hasn't quite recovered to its normal level.

Is this cause for real concern or just a blip? Is the same thing that happened to UST happening slowly to USDT?

I‚Äôm just a regular moron so please poke holes in this because I can‚Äôt get it out of my head.

Also if you haven‚Äôt seen this yet, watch it - Coffeezilla‚Äôs video \[Exposing Tether - Bitcoin's Biggest Secret\]([https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-whuXHSL1Pg&feature=youtu.be](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-whuXHSL1Pg&feature=youtu.be))",70,81,False," Well if this continues we can test how much tether is actually backed ü§°  Check Coffeezilla video on Tether and how it is backed... Not sure why anyone would use USDT over other options.

Yes there ""might"" be risks involved in the completely unregulated, shady, unaudited, opaque unstable-coin.

I am not saying USDC doesn't have risks but they are regulated, funds held in custodial accounts, and audited monthly by a third party.

USDT is ""pray we have $1 in assets for every 1 USDT"" and worse that we could actually sell those assets in time to allow redemptions. Popcorn time Fir Tree Capital Management has a short strategy, but you asked for a mechanism, and the mechanism for a mere $4B hedge fund to do this is unclear to me.  They expect their plan to work within the next 10 months. 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-11/hedge-fund-fir-tree-bets-big-with-short-of-stablecoin-tether I doubt it. According to genesis spools, the USDT farming pools are largely covered in the low risk pools. What is happening with Tether is absolutely different from what happened to UST. Nevertheless, it does not mean that you shouldn't keep your eyes open because the crypto space is a freaking crazy space. No, if anything its a good sign.

Them de-pegging likely led to people escaping into other stable coins, so they must have burned the excess usdt. USDT and UST have compleatly different tokenomics Luna/UST was giant ponzi scheme that would collapse sooner or later ,nearly all ponzis that offer ""passive income"" have a slow grind up and violent crash 

USDT doesnt have a problem of death spiral like UST,and certain collapse, it survived few bear markets. But there are major concers that not every USDT is backed 1:1 to dollar and if all people start selling there wont be enough money for everyone.
Your best bet is when you are not trading just convert to real $ or coin like USDC , or if exchange only has USDT as a trading pair open a short position on it to minimaze the risk I don't think there is any correlation or cause for concern. However I think there ought to be a general caution when it comes to stable coins. Spread them around BUSD, USDT, USDC and DAI. That is the most reasonable thing to do. The yield strategies on covers all stable coins and it has been considered consistently to be the standard for a risk-management in yield farming. At this point, I consider anyone who is still 'all in' into a particular stable coin to be out rightly insensitive Stable coins fluctuate with activity. The FUD going around right now about Tether is basically a lot of people posting about things they don't understand. Also, UST wasn't built like USDT. They are two totally different technologies. Yes it is, but not for what you think. Theter isn't going to depeg, but whales are exiting the market. No new money = no bull run. This is concerning,but because it is macro bearish. No, **in fact it's very good news.**

If Tether is properly backed 1:1 with real assets, its market cap can go to zero and it'll prove that USDT is a real stablecoin, and not 'money from thin air' which many people (including myself) have feared since about 2017.

Tether's unit value is the important thing. As long as it stays very close to $1USD, everything is rosy.

It's when/if its unit value starts decreasing along with its market cap that things get interesting. A rational investor would panic and take 90c in the dollar if that happens, thus causing more selling pressure and a price crash.

If tether can go to a very low market cap and retain it's USD peg, that proves the critics wrong and shows that Bitcoin's market cap is real - and not just a result of Tether printing money every time it dips.

... of course, if it does de-peg, that'd prove the critics right and raise concerns that Bitcoin's meteoric rise in 2017 and price ever since was caused by Tether printing USDT fake money... putting a retracement to below $5,000 on the cards.   
Some would see that as concerning, others as an excellent buying opportunity. After the whole UST debacle, people are diversifying their stablecoin holdings. I believe the Mcap of tether dropped because alot of people have sold it to buy other stablecoins. This is actually good, if rather does at some point in time collapse it might not completely take the whole crypto market with it, as other stablecoins are gaining some strength Could tether fall and depeg? Absolutely. 

Your scenario with 30k -> 10k -> 100k BTC sounds rather silly tho. Whales have power sure, but that is beyond any whale or big institution buying like that. Moving Btc or even USDT is not as simple as the Luna death spiral because the reflexivity is much less. 

Then again, i dont think u need such an outrageous scenario to make tether fall, probably the extended bear market with low liquidity + perhaps imminent recession + incoming regulation will do the job. If it doesn‚Äôt then maybe tether is here to stay‚Ä¶ No not yet . I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if someone try to attack USDT because of the UST failure. I think it be okay for a few years.
Uk are probably cashing in USDT because they make 10 % profit more than if they sold just before Christmas because of USDT to GBP currency exchange rates have soared like crazy. I made $100 profit per $1000 exchanged to GBP compared to last year. Last year ¬£720 per $1000. This year ¬£820 per $1000. It is possible that there is a bit of fallout from the terra/luna case. Terra's stablecoin fall is something that makes people worried and withdraw their funds / exchange for coins To answer your question. YES. It is cause for major concern. Crypto is pretty shook atm and along with the slide in stonks, the blood letting is just getting started. Just trust me bro. Are you asking that if the fact that the world's largest ""stablecoin"" is crashing is concerning? ü§° I don't think that could happen, Tether has 76,108,834,461$ market cap right now, assuming that they have backed by real cash a 3%( Hopefully is more but let's go to a extreme case) that means people need to sell 2,283,265,033$ so they will be ""out of cash"". Only with the Tether that is on exchanges I think it will be covered (Exchanges probably will put their money first to not crash the market, waiting for tether payback). 

So the panic needed to sell all of this I don't think could happen. Mainly because most of the Tether are in big wallets and these people will not do it because they know the consequences of that and they and their whales friends don't want to lose their money.

But it is just my opinion, if something I have learnt from crypto is that everything can happen, big crashes or big bull runs in any moment They would go to jail if they did this Hey what‚Äôs up, my name is Alex, Alex Hamilton.

[In other words, when they eventually go bankrupt, they will use YOUR crypto to bail themselves out.]",https://i.redd.it/wb8as1oniry81.png,,155,51,False," No, they will use THEIR crypto to bail themselves out.

The balance displayed on an exchange wallet isn't crypto, and its only ""yours"" in the sense that you can readily turn it into crypto and withdraw it. It's nothing more than a non-binding ""IOU"" note from the exchange to you.

There's no guarantee that any large exchange holds enough crypto to be able to pay all its customers out according to their wallet balances. It's called fractional reserve banking, and it's a thing.

Not your keys, not your wallet. That‚Äôs not what it says........it‚Äôs a SEC filing addressing the risks in their business stating that a bankruptcy court could do that. Not a business plan, FFS. the FUD is strong with this one My cryptos are very secured probably in China right now since all my long positions have been vaporized. You'll be treated like an investor. Your bank will do the same. So we buy coins at Coinbase. Not your keys, not your coins! Is real this? Nothing is safe to leave crypto in coinbase? coinbase has always been scumbags idk why you are surprised Not you keys .......... yeah not like banks...wait hold up Disgusting. \#QredoFixesThis People will still leave it on coinbase. They think to big to fail. Same people that have only been around for a year and know everything Just keep your funds in your own custody and stake to earn rewards. I'm staking ICP for 28% APY, which beats anything Coinbase can offer and there is no risk. So is coin base wallet not safe either??? Plz answer I got a lot of shit to sort if so Same as any other bank Centralized Exchanges has always used and abused customers for their own wealth growth like Banks do everyday. They are the main gainers behind these market crashes. Coinbase always cared about themselves since the beginning. They never cared about the healthy development of the crypto industry. Look at the coins they choose to add and you will have an idea of their amateurism that is so badly disguised. 

I have been saying this a couple of times. Coinbase is not changing their approach towards the industry and they will gradually collapse. As a main player, they *must* contribute decisively to the crypto growth benefiting everyone. Yet, they can‚Äôt take their eyes off their fat belly that is shrinking and will continue to do so.

Actually it will be bad if Coinbase is removed from the market but it will be good in the long run. jesus christ. move out of coinbase into a hard wallets, everyone should know this by now.

on an unrelated note, i almost shorted coin a few months ago and the ONLY reason i didnt was bc i got busy and forgot. im kicking myself right now. This is why, be it shiryo or BTC, i save it in a hardware wallet.

A lot of people are just hopping on the bandwagon to in fact create more profit via this centrally controlled fiat , but I think aslong as the stock market is still a thing it will def be influenced by general market emotions This connection you have noticed is due to the amount of money traditional hedge funds have playing in crypto.... for some insane reason the majority of retail crypto investors still think its 2015 and no institutional money is in the crypto markets..... nothing could be further from the truth! 

What you are noticing is a symptom of that happening and the amount of money they have in crypto is a tiny fraction of the capital they have to deploy, yet they still move and control crypto markets! 

We are seeing the market games of old that were used in the early stock market to extract value for institutional investors being played out again. These games of market control/manipulation have been regulated out of the traditional stock market (though they just switched up to more refined and subtle manipulation) but in crypto, its the wild west with no regulation so they will get while the getting is good. 

This is unpopular so I expect it will be down voted but it doesn't change facts or the symptoms like OP has noticed. When Will the global market break free of the influence of the U.S. stock exchange??!!

> ""For the risk-off asset narrative to return, institutional investors must see a decline in bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the S&P 500,"" Sam Kopelman, U.K. manager at bitcoin and crypto exchange Luno, said in emailed comments. ""Only then will the promise of cryptocurrency as a hedge investment be revived."" Because the investors are the same people. It‚Äôs a risky asset, and in times of trouble, risk is the first thing to go. Just look at ARKK, Tesla, etc. When the meme stock shorting situation is resolved. Until then, crypto is their pump and dump for liquidity. So the general crypto market is likely to remain correlated with US stocks as long as

a) Bitcoin dominance continues to receded,

b) utility altcoins continue to gain dominance in the crypto market,

c) the US economy remains the largest, or at least one of the largest, economies in the world

d) the US dollar remains, or is one among a few, global reserve currencies

The value of almost every global assets is influenced by US stocks given the US is the largest economy and the US dollar is the global reserve currency. Even gold and other precious metals are influenced more so by the US stock market and US Treasury rates than say the Nikkei, the London Stock Exchange,  the Hong Kong Exchange, or the Euro yield curve simply because of its size. It's not pegged to the stock exchange. Crypto and stocks are correlated.",0.9908

Over the next 2 months there are multiple events which individually are bullish, but as a whole are pretty much guaranteed to cause a monumental pump for Radix. I'll break these down, but first, in case you've never heard of it, a very quick overview of Radix:

Radix is the first and only DLT to [solve the trilemma without breaking *atomic composability*.](https://www.radixdlt.com/post/cerberus-infographic-series-chapter-i) AC's important, google it for an explanation. They are also developing a [Dapp platform](https://www.radixdlt.com/post/scrypto-an-asset-oriented-smart-contract-language) that is stupidly easy for devs to use, and [far less prone to hacks than Solidity](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q1uo2s/the_problem_with_smart_contracts_today_and_what). Radix has been very carefully designed to tick all the boxes necessary for DeFi to take over TradFi. Everything has been considered.

Now, why will it moon over the next 2 months?


***API Update  & Exchange Listings***

Radix went live on mainnet around 3 months ago. At that time, the team put in a whole bunch of effort working with bitfinex to get it listed there. This required some ""fudging"" to get the exchange to work with the API. To get listed on more exchanges would require more fudging, and every fudge would require exponentially more work for all future updates.

Instead of pushing for more immediate listings, the team thought long term and decided the best option would be to refactor the API to fit ever exchanges requirements. Reading between the lines from a message on the developer chat a couple of months back, this is due to be completed in November.

Once this is done, exchanges can integrate with Radix far more easily, meaning, once the API is announced, we are likely to see a slew of exchange listings.

Further hints at exchange listings come from the Ethereum wrapped version of the token, EXRD, getting listed on Coinbase custody, and one of the Radix team being spotted chatting to Binance execs at a conference in Lisbon.

Finally, a big barrier to exchange listing is trading volume. Supposedly, $6m daily is what's needed for binance. Radix has been creeping up in volume for months now, and the recent pump in price has put daily volume at over $40m for a week now.


***Correct Market Cap Listing***

Right now Radix is sitting on a respectable $4bn market cap. That puts the network around 50th in terms of market cap. But, if you go on coinmarketcap or coingecko today you will see Radix languishing in spot #300 or so, alongside a bunch of shitcoins. API refactoring and exchange listings will catapult XRD into the top 50, which will get people talking, and get people to notice the project. Radix's main problem has been visibility, and soon everybody will be watching.


***Smart Contract Alpha Release***

Right now the Radix network functionality is pretty simple. You can transact (with sub second finality), stake, create coins, send those created coins. In 1 week the developer preview of the new smart contracts will happen, where devs can get their hands dirty actually using the new language designed specifically to meet all the needs of defi. The Alpha release, where devs can start building prototype dapps will come shortly after. This is the moment where smart money will really be able to assess the value proposition of Radix. Right now, there are a few devs who've seen previews, and they are fucking excited.


***The Global Takeover Marketing Event***

Finally, there is a community marketing fund. They've just poured a whole bunch of money into real marketing, banners on the ground in financial centers around the world. I'm speculating on details, but they tweeted this will reach 100m people. So, expect to see the Radix logo all over the likes of London, New York, Frankfurt, Singapore, etc. 


***Tl;dr***

Radix has fundamentals like no other. The only problem it has had so far is visibility. Most people in crypto aren't really aware of it's existence, let alone in TradFi. The next 2 months will firmly put the project on the map for a whole bunch of reasons. The cat is being let out the bag. There is a perfect storm of bullish material that, based on historic market trends, will line up beautifully with alt season. There is generational wealth to be made here. This is Ethereum at $2.",53,97,False," thanks for the write up. i‚Äôll add on - this project is 8 years in the making. it‚Äôs not something a few kids whipped together overnight to ‚Äòsolve defi‚Äô. Strongly suggest you follow Dan Hughes on twitter (founder) he‚Äôs been demo‚Äôing a rebuild of twitter (yes - the Twitter application) on Radix + a bunch of technical feats that will help you understand the magnitude of the tech. 

When you think Crypto Investment + generational wealth - Radix IS one of the project that can fundamentally change the game and open the flood gates for moving trillions of institutional money ( not just retail peer to peer $). Radix will have the fastest TPS for complex smart contracts period. 

Also just add - for those of us who‚Äôve been following this project for a long time - it‚Äôs true what @fun_Excitement_5306 said - the project hasn‚Äôt been marketed - and we love that. This team has the patience and trust in their tech to wait ‚Ä¶ but now ‚Ä¶ millions of people are about to get educated and developers will flood to Scrypto and start building apps on Radix üöÄ Heh, it seems it has pumped quite a bit since I bought it on a whim what feels like ages ago :)

It seems that the best profits are made on coins that you buy without thinking and basically forget all about that you even have them :) I agree with this, the token unlock was bullish; a dump that was bought back immediately.

Radix attended WebSummit at Lisbon where they were still being asked questions an hour after forklifts were packing the stands up. If you look at websummit dates and volume increase, it‚Äôs not hard to see what happened there..

And then [they‚Äôve got their APE event in New York](https://twitter.com/radixdlt/status/1458449073304899589?s=21) on Friday where they unveil their dev tools.

All this, tons more plus the tech is unquestionably awesome. Couldn‚Äôt be more bullish for Radix For the record, when i say moon in 2 months, I'm talking comparable market cap to SOL or ADA, so short term upside potential is 20x. The maximum likely downside in the coming years, **hyper** pessimistically, would be 4c, the ICO price. This would only happen with a complete crypto bubble pop.

The maximum possible moon would be if all tradfi was built on Radix*, so that's about $450T in value on Radix. If this was the case i would guess that a fair mcap for XRD would be $10T, so a 2500x upside potential over the next 10 years.

*For DeFi to displace TradFi, the network would need to be trilemma solving, atomically composable and easy to build on, and only Radix can do all of that. I am not convinced by the idea that Radix suddenly appearing in the top 50 will lead to positive outcomes. This will raise eyebrows.

Existing investors who haven't paid attention to their tokenomic will get a shock to find out their investment's market cap shoot up but the price of XRD will remain the same. Some people will realise that Radix will never shoot up as high as they had expected when they first invested. A 150x will be more like a 15x at best in the short term.

I know people should think long term when investing, but this is a bull market, people are dreaming of high returns. This change in market cap on Coin gecko and other similar platforms will definitely create some noise, but this will come with some very disappointed holders and negativity.

Let's see, but let's not assume it's all going to go smoothly and ""moon"". I believe a slower release of these tokens would have maybe have a more inconspicuous impact? I don't know, I guess we will see! But I doubt this is ETH at $2, we are way past this. More like ETH around $40 (not to say it's bad, but we should be realistic. Also ETH didn't have to deal with much competition around that time) Where do you buy? Nice write up. It's flying under the radar for most of the crypto community as of now. People might be scared of the long development time and that many of Radix' big updates are comparably too far in the future, but its fundamentals are rock solid. When Radix will unlock its full potential with the Xian update in 2023, most likely other crypto projects that are shining now will fail to keep up. What do think about the potential of $NFTb? Some friends of my are really into it but I do not see it. I‚Äôd love to hear a non biased comparison of this and IOTA [removed] [removed] [removed] /u/Fun_Excitement_5306 what would you say the best way to acquire this token would be as a US citizen?

With the help of some talented Redditors and GitHub contributors, the algorithm is now more powerful than before, allowing you to further configure how you would like it to trade.

Many of the improvements made, were actually suggested by you in the previous post, so thanks to you all, there is now a better news algo that we can all use!

The algorithm analyses the news sentiment from biggest crypto news sites, and automatically decides what coins to buy or sell based on how many times a coin is mentioned across all headlines, and how positively or negatively it's depicted in the news headlines.

I've been working on this project for about a month now, and I can say that the bot is now in a state where it can be used and it's stable! I haven't yet tested it on the mainnet but I will put together some reports on its performance on the testnet and will post on here.

Here is the link to the open-sourced project:

It's probably my most complex trading algorithm yet, and I'm happy to share it with this community because you reacted so nicely to my other projects!

Here's quick overview of what the bot does:

1. Pulls and analyzes the last headline from the top 100 crypto news sites
2. Provide an overview on the most mentioned coin across all the headlines
3. Analyse the sentiment of each headline and categorises the output by coin
4. Places a Buy order if the compound sentiment is positive and the a coin is mentioned in multiple headlines
5. It works with any cryptocurrency available on Binance

Here are some considerations that I am planning address in the future:

1. I accidentally used Feedspospot's top 100 Bitcoin feeds, so the sources are a bit biased right now
2. During my testing the compound sentiment wasn't high enough and wouldn't place a lot of trades
3. It can probably make use of multiprocessing to increase performance

8,"The amount of Ethereum (ETH) staked on the Beacon Chain has reached its highest-ever levels, but some observers are growing concerned over a large sell-off after the Merge.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/v4cfhc/the_amount_of_ethereum_eth_staked_on_the_beacon/,"The amount of ETH staked in the Beacon Chain smart contract has reached 12.76 million according to Glassnode. It reported that 398,000 unique validators have staked and an additional 19,800 staked and came online in May. 

Glassnode also claims that the amount of staked ETH is 10.73% of the circulating supply. At current prices, the value of those locked up assets is around $23.3 billion.

Other sources vary slightly with the Ethereum Launchpad dashboard reporting 13.36 million ETH staked, which works out at 11% of the total supply.

Either way, the increase in staking and validating is a vote of confidence for the Ethereum ecosystem in a bear market that is mired in negative sentiment and FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) at the moment.

The Merge effect

The highly anticipated Ethereum Merge is set to take place in Aug, however it has some industry onlookers concerned. The Merge will end proof-of-work mining and transition the network to proof-of-stake reducing its energy consumption by more than 99%.

Many in the crypto community seem to think that all of this staked ETH will be sold to markets once the Merge takes place. This is unlikely to occur for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the staked assets will not be immediately released when the Merge takes place as it is needed to secure the network and guarantee consensus. Secondly, the ETH will be released in tranches and not all at once so it will trickle back into markets rather than flood them.

From a price perspective, fundamentals are not usually factored in during bear market conditions so it is unlikely that ETH prices will surge when the Merge takes place. Some industry experts are of the opinion that the Merge will be bullish for Ethereum prices, but only time will tell.

* It can sell coins when the news sentiment is negative
* It's a lot faster - it used to take 107 seconds to analyse 100 feeds, it now only takes about 7 seconds
* It knows the minimum quantity for each coin
* It allows you to pair your crypto to anything else, not just USDT

GameStop has already made huge waves in the crypto community. And Stripe, the 5th largest fintech company in the world and the 6th most used payment app in the US is working with Polygon. Also, Instagram is working with Polygon as well to enable users to display their NFT on their profiles.

The short-term sentiment of the market looks horrible right now, but if you look long term all you can see is bullish news on bullish news. That‚Äôs just my opinion but it‚Äôs an opinion that‚Äôs backed by facts.",7,9,False," When is BTC hitting $8k Agreed. IMO Cryptos aren‚Äôt dying, they‚Äôre just on sale right now. More and more people are getting into cryptocurrency, which means growth in the long term

BTC will be 100k and more, it's just a matter of time, I can say the same about ETH at 10k and more, the more that ETH is actively used to buy NFT, I myself have recently bought NFT from AngelBlock for ETH, by the way minting is still going

Country representatives are already gathering on forums to discuss the impact and acceptance of cryptocurrency as a means of payment, which means that cryptocurrency will be accepted by many countries in the near future

8,"We have never had a crypto market during recession, you might want to think about it if you want your money intact",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/uxicxp/we_have_never_had_a_crypto_market_during/,"We are headed towards   recession, and this current situation in Ukraine is almost making it a certainty. How does this affect the crypto market you might ask ? Well no one knows because  during the last recession there was no such thing as a crypto market.   


Now my opinion is that this will be felt deeply in the crypto market because when people start worrying about having to put food on the table and gas in their cars the last thing on their minds will be tokens NFTs and currencies that could crash at any time, and especially in those countries that aren't In North America and west Europe.  


In my opinion a lot of people will sell off what currency they have in order to have cash on hand.   


For those of us who are fortunate enough not to worry about food and gas, I think we should stay in the game but diversify our funds to companies that also use blockchain technology but don't necessarily only have cryptocurrency but are engaged in other sectors of commerce like telecommunications, sustainable energy for example what WePower, PowerLedger, World Mobile Token, Telcoin just to name a few for you to  understand where I am going with this.  


Think about it, what makes crypto special is blockchain, and blockchain is the future for many sectors and not just a way to make BTC and other currencies and I believe that these other applications might be more recession proof.  


Do you share my sentiments, what are your opinions on this subject, is my reasoning correct ?",5,17,False," We are in a recession, Anyone recommending buying any crypto that isn‚Äôt dirt cheap btc or eth just simply has zero clue what they are talking about.

This recession/crash will all be forgotten. You won't even remember it. LOL Don't be so short-term!!! Think BIG!!! GLTA!!! Exchange your bags for XMR Macro actually doesn't look good. 

I think more downside is coming, and a good strategy is to be mostly in stables now, with some little exposure to the market as well.

[BTC](https://getblock.io/nodes/btc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) market dominance stood at 40.9% on Saturday, retreating sharply from the 42% seen on Thursday. While the token is trading up 5% for the week, it has been vastly outpaced by smaller coins this week.

8,The interesting relation between sentiment of Crypto headlines vs BTC price,https://i.redd.it/64srmr7mfs661.png,,5,5,False," I have written an algo determining (crypto specific) sentiment, I ran this on a dataset with crypto news headlines (about 900k headlines). From that I compared sentiment to the BTC.

Data gathering and analysis is done using Python. Sentiment is calculated by scoring each headline from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive), averaging per day and plotting over time. Interestingly there definitely is a relation. Actual plot is interactive so you can have a look at certain time periods in more depth if you like. is it not the case that an asset class rapidly increasing in value is likely to be garnering more press coverage, and crypto press is predominantly bullish on BTC at the best of times

8,I made a news based indicator for Bitcoin that programmatically charts news volume (and news sentiment) every 10 minutes to detect events and breaking news as soon as they occur. The news data is pulled from Google's news feed. The chart can be used as a trading indicator or investment tool.,https://i.redd.it/ryo6xnhq11761.png,,30,2,True," This is where you can refer to the [Bitcoin news Indicator](https://bitcointweets.com/admin/Bitcoin-News).

&#x200B;

**Why did I make this?**

I wanted to see if sudden surges in news volume moved Bitcoin price. Surges in news volume could indicate some breaking news event that everyone is racing to report and I wanted to know right away. This is also why created an alert system (very simple and powered by Amazon's SNS) that triggers whenever news volume is double the 24 hour average.

I'm also interested to see how the long term data looks and charting average hourly news volume over a few years worth of time seems like an accurate way to show how Bitcoin will become mainstream.

&#x200B;

**How does it work?**

The backend is completely serverless and everything runs on AWS. The frontend is React. As of now I have a 4 hour chart and a 24 hour chart. More importantly, I have an alerts system that's very reliable (also powered by AWS) that pings you if there's a surge in news volume.

&#x200B;

**Results:**

I've been recording the data for a couple of months now, before I made the charts public. Obviously when Bitcoin hit ATH I could see how news volume skyrocketed. What was more interesting is how Tweets per minute about Bitcoin (which I also record) went up to 1200 when the average is actually around 150 tweets per minute. Bottom line is that user activity and news activity were very high a few hours before ATH (as one would expect). Looks like the positive articles are almost a mirror.. pretty neat.",0.9776

8,Are cryptos in a bubble right now? Let us gauge the sentiment,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/6uyoh0/are_cryptos_in_a_bubble_right_now_let_us_gauge/,"I've seen a number of bubbles since the early 1980's. Baseball cards were my first experience with bubbles. I collected them because I liked them. Prices began to rise. Soon Wall Street bankers were buying them as speculative investments. They didn't really like them - they liked the money. Then U.S. real estate in late 80's. Then the DotCom bubble. The Internet was extremely interesting and had almost unlimited potential. Everyone could see it. Then the IPO's started and the valuations grew. Then all anyone saw was the money. I knew people that were mortgaging their house and taking the money and buying .com stocks of companies that had never made a dime (and never did). Then there was the Ferrari boom after that. Then the second U.S. real estate bubble in the early 2000's. The oil bubble. the U.S. Treasury bond bubble. There's the possible current bubble in stocks and real estate again right now. I guess I should throw in the six-pack abs advertising bubble as well. Wealth is created and destroyed over and over. Like in a casino, some win, most lose in the long run.

The focus on wealth, income and consumer lifestyle is so strong these days that people are like schools of fish that dart from one potential money making scheme to the next, always trying to be the first one in. The accessibility and efficiency of information on the internet make the school move far faster than it used too.

Crypto has followed the bubble path. As NT said above though ""Everyone knows it's a bubble. We still expect it to go higher."" There are so many variables involved it's basically impossible to even form a rational assumption as to what is going to happen though. The vast majority in these forums are far more interested in making money from the price appreciation of crypto than pursuing the original ideology behind it of destroying or damaging the legacy banking system or halting governments intrusion into privacy. That's unfortunate because that's what really gives crypto its value.

90% of the coins out there are useless. They have no value. They all use the same website templates, spout the same rhetoric and wild claims but haven't actually done anything and never will. Yet, millions of dollars are thrown at them eagerly. That is what always happens in bubbles. The ICO creators will spend that money. It will disappear and they still will not have done anything useful.

The infighting and cannibalization going on in the BTC/BCH/BTC2X arena is another sign. Bitcoin has grown big enough that now everyone wants to try to control it. You hear very little about BTC disrupting anything anymore (except maybe from A.Antonop). It's more about business, scalability, speculation etc. Well, the truth is that almost NO ONE uses crypto. NO ONE. As a percentage of all economic transactions that occur in a day, those involving crypto are essentially negligible. In fact, the dominant amount of volume is just speculators trading back and forth on exchanges. That's not economic adoption. It's just hopeful speculation. The general public just laughs at crypto right now and it probably won't change for some time, if ever. Not with 3 or 4 different versions of BTC fighting it out, 900 different crypto ponzi's running at any given time, and massive hacks or raids occurring on a weekly basis.

Any newbie trying to learn is going to have to navigate YouTube's plethora of less than honest propaganda pushing affiliate codes for Genesis, hashflare, bitconnect etc. If they do find valid instructive videos then they'll still have to wade through all the slop about BCH vs BTC vs BTC1 vs BTC2X etc.

As one who got into crytpo as an ideologue it's frustrating to watch. It's like supporting a presidential candidate because of their pre election speeches and then watching them get into office and do absolutely nothing of what they said they would do because they sell out at the first opportunity. That's basically every election here in the U.S. - on both sides. Crypto was a new realm where I thought I could avoid the hyperbole and rhetoric of politics. Maybe move away from the usual glacial speed of change in society and move toward something new and disruptive. But, alas, that may not be the case.

So, I believe we are in a bubble. The only question is whether it will be a fatal bubble or just a setback. Will it be a long term setback or short term from which the crypto space will recover quickly? I don't know. We'll find out soon enough I guess. A bubble popping will be good. It will purge the space of speculators that could care less about financial innovation and that school of fish will move on to something else. Then we can get back to disruption.

Tell me what you think. Maybe you can also answer this poll to express your sentiment: http://www.strawpoll.me/13751827",138,136,False," ICOs are in a classic bubble. Vaporware (sometimes even with anonymous devs? lol...) are raising capital on a single white paper. It's literally insane. I assume most of the funds are paper gains being fired off because of blind greed and a desire to just gamble. 

Then you have an ICO like 0x that could've raised all of their money via VC but chose a token sale, and you glimpse the future of consistently high quality ICOs, and it's beautiful.

Is crypto itself in a bubble? Perhaps. It took years for the dotcom bubble to materialize into real companies doing work commensurate with the hype. That gap was attributable mostly to lack of actual tech and talent. This time around it's just a reallocation of resources. If the big tech companies wanted to build an ETH dapp they could do it tomorrow (and some are). 

I think it's possible/likely we see some price correction in the next 6 months, but equally likely we never see $250 ETH again. I don't think anyone can really predict it with any confidence. The only thing that I can asssert with confidence is that an ETH-like platform will underpin a huge amount of commerce in the next 2/5/10 years. The idea is undeniably powerful.

BTC...absolutely no idea what the next 6 months will bring. Makes my had spin trying to understand exactly what's driving what. Bubble isn't the right word for whatever that mess is. [deleted] I agree. We're in a bubble. It sucks, and many people will lose a lot of money while others will make a lot of money.

However, blockchain is revolutionary. People who understand what it offers get excited about it. And yes, that excitement is misdirected into coins that offer no true value. It's unfortunate, but unavoidable. 

In 10 years the Amazons and Ebays and Paypals of crypto will emerge and the hucksters will fade away. But by then their true valuation will be priced in and there won't be as much opportunity.

Personally, I'm trying to find those coins that truly offer something. Bitcoin offers value storage. That's all it does well imo. But that's enough. Ethereum is a platform, already proven to be here to stay. I'm looking for the next coin to offer something compelling. I have a hunch it will be one that bridges the gap between the old financial world and the new, which is why PAY and OMG are interesting to me.  From an outsider, it really looks like the Tulip Bubble! But you know what, when great traditionnal banks decide to use blockchain for their bank-to-bank transfers, it has a clear value.

You can have a Visa card in the US that all works with an Ethereum wallet.

Soon there will be lots of dapp (decentralised applications) that will run on crypto and agencies and companies will gladly pay to obtain those rare Ether to shoot them with their code so it gets first in line!

Even if I believe it‚Äôs undervalued, I stil think it grows too fast. With gains, we see corrections. With monstruous gains, monstruous drops! We are in the opposite of a bubble.  Crypto is enormously undervalued. You have to also take into account that crypto is still a relatively new technology. It's not being used, because it's not ready for primetime. Aside from the wild price speculation and numerous scam ICO's, there's still a lot of development being done that will eventually cause a disruption. Money should be neutral, otherwise it's not money it's a political weapon. 

I mean, you can use money for charity, spectulation, make more money, change the world, payments, or whatever you want. Money should not be intended to achieve the goals of a particular point of view, if money lose its neutrality it's not money anymore. 

This said, I think governments will have a bad time trying to collect taxes from anonymous money. Cryptomoney has the potential of overcoming the states and create a new world order. We will eventually get to a point of no return of mass adoption where a bitcoin economy will be created spontaneusly, by the people itself, because of the advantages of Bitcoin over government money. But this takes time and we are still in a very, very early stage.  

Even if we are in a bubble (bitcoin has suffered several bubbles already) Bitcoin is not a company, Bitcoin can't go bankrupt and cease its activity, so no matter how many bubbles burst it will always be there ready to be used as money, no matter if its worth $5000 or $5. 

EDIT: By the way, I agree 90% or even more coins are useless and will be gone in a few years.  [deleted] Soo...wait...didn't I write this OP? Is there a purpose in co-opting it? people are still selling cars, tech companies still exist, and as far as I know, houses still go on sale each day, therefore I am confident in the belief that crypto will continue regardless of ""the market"".

The real question is, will the end result be what the market expects? 

I am confident the answer is no, but that is not stopping me investing in ICOs/ crypto, rather I use it to inform my choices about what I believe will still be around when the tornado hits and the dust settles.

My personal opinion is that the many bitcoin forks indicate weakness aswell as greed, not strength as you might expect. If many parties can say ""we can do this better!"" then you don't have a unique selling point any more. all you have are competitors. I would call it a balloon. Much more elastic.  [deleted] Credit where credit is due, you copied and pasted this from /u/MiyMusashi, who gave this response when you posted a similar sentiment on /r/BitcoinMarkets earlier today. I was thinking the exact same thing. The recent money flowing into crypto is astonishing, and that includes me. Check out the growth in cap share from coinmarketcap, just a huge spike out of nowhere.

 ~~Great post, well written and argumented, an none of the usual hyperbole. I gave you a lot of shit for your FUD~~ ~~copypasta but this one is different, respect.~~

~~So even if you probably don¬¥t give a fuck, have an upvote.~~

EDIT: See below. He still is the saddest clown on reddit. These kind of posts make me realize we still have way more exuberance left to go. Time to make some money. [deleted] I used to think like you but then i realized why bitcoin is not in bubble.The real purpose of bitcoin is not everyday usage instead OF dollar or euro. It's real value comes from 'Store of value'.It has limited supply.So it will not take place of dollar or euro but it will take place of GOLD It's just getting started, blockchain is the next huge thing in the world and cryptos are a driving factor in introduction of people to the blockchain, some worthless ones will spiral out, but the ones that don't could score big time. It's very similar to the .com bubble The internet bubble of the 90s is probably the best comparison. The internet did not go away. Companies, the ones without vaporware, the true innovators - are still around in some form. The shitty companies that ignorant investors threw money at hoping to get rich quick - are simply a bad memory.

The same will happen with crypto. Ethereum is here to stay, and if bitcoin can stop shooting itself, it will be as well. Some of the well positioned and vetted tokens (OMG for example) have a huge potential in the future. The rest will soon become, to many, a bad memory.

Anytime people aggressively throw money at shit they have no knowledge of simply to make a buck, will create a bubble. The good news is that it's a natural part of the evolution: bubbles form, bubbles break, plebs shake out, and the innovation continues. The innovators, early believers, and those who put in their due diligence usually suffer the least pain. The guys taking out loans to invest, trading on margin, throwing crypto on credit cards, the people speculating on what a coins worth with no understanding of market cap, the ignorant crowd that consider OmiseGo / Wagerr / Mysterium equally likely to be successful - those are the types who will lose ""yuge"".

Wise investment strategies work across a variety of mediums. I agree we will he in a bubble at some point, but for now, we're not even getting started. 

Crypto awareness is growing by the day, there will be a lot of new money entering the market over the next year or so, in addition to some institutional money at some point in the not too distant future. 

When it pops, maybe in 1-2 years time, it will be great, some will lose a lot of money, but that's necessary for crypto to be positioned to survive, we need to get rid of these crap ICO projects at some point and that will be the time to do it. 

 Good products are things people need. Good products don't speak bubble language. Even if they ICO in the middle of the gold rush (like Amazon IPOd back in the day), and even if they will feel the corrections to come, if they're truly a good product they will prevail. 

So from a long term investor perspective, it's fairly easy to stay out of companies you think might go bust: invest on stuff you use/will use. This doesn't assure success, nothing does, but it's a good basic  filter.

As for teams, good ones are made of people that were ""opressed"" in some sense, and are fighting back with Dapps. Blockchain enables this kind of revolution. This opressors might be laws, governments, banks, other institutions... Who knows what's coming. 

Only dumb or short term investors would put their money on stuff they wouldn't use. They're no different in current crypto space: short term investment on companies with 0 users is just playing lottery. With certain technologies in this field we are definitely *not* in a bubble e.g. ETH, PARTICL. With many chains however I believe we are. to be honest i am confused about this ""bubble"" thing, in my opinion a bubble is something that bursts and is dead. looking at all the ""bubbles"" dotcom, housing etc it all still there. people still have tech companies that are racking up millions and people are still squatting and selling .com's. i would have thought when a bubble bursts thats the end of it.

maybe we should clarify what a bubble is cause i think BTC has popped a few times now if you follow its track record. If you're asking if the only thing most people can see is easy money and not the technology behind the coins, the fight against banks and centralisation and the future of value storing, legal contracts and worldwide transactions, then yes. We're in a bubble.

What will happen next? Well, this is actually different from other bubbles because in this particular case, many coins are designed to replace money itself, so they'll keep a good part of their price (at least the ones that survive). Things will settle down after a few years and even if coins and tokens can store value, people will start using them focusing on what they can do with them, instead of speculating. Just like we don't care much about the price of a domain and simply buy the one we need and use it like anything else. I really appreciated this topic. Totally agree with you. The only thing I have to criticise is, that the answers in the poll are not very differenciated. 
I do believe it is a bubble and I totally do believe it will be a long term setback in the distant future, with only a ~~handful~~ about 50 of coins/tokens remaining after it pops.   I can imagine terraforming looking like a sort of a bubble, in the beginning, but then it takes over the entire planet ;)

We cannot judge what it happening using the current economic and financial logic, since we are assessing the very process of the system's replacement with a different, better system. Just like the internet (a decentralized network tech) is gradually replacing every legacy communication channel (mail, newspapers, telecom, radio and tv broadcasting, etc..) while adding many new innovative ones, blockchain (a decentralized database tech) will gradually replace every legacy financial, legal and bureaucratic solution, while adding it's own set. And just as with the Internet, It won't happen in a day, but the direction we're heading is bright and clear. You can't disrupt without anyone using crypto to buy real things, regardless of whether or not the profiteers leave. You almost NEED the profiteers in order to reach the level of recognition needed to grow. Only time will tell. But I do believe that without PoS, and without material usage, almost every crypto is unsustainable in the long term. Funny to see this now after the past 4 weeks' price movements but to put some things in perspective: Cryptomarket currently = ~$135m; Nasdaq at dot com bubble = ~ $6.7 trillion",0.9991

8,"Ive build a model that recognizes fear in headlines, tweets, chatter etc and plotted a time series of fear levels over time vs BTC returns",https://i.redd.it/0v3zeftanwi71.png,,367,112,False," Cool idea. Take any constructive tips from the comments, ignore unhelpful criticism and keep going. Fear is one the most influencing of human emotions and quite possibly the most elusive to measure. Whoever figures out how to measure the physical manifestation of fear in the world within a 10% margin will make trillions of dollars. 

This indicator, if even remotely accurate could be iterated to become more accurate over time and quickly become one of the most valuable vlauble indicators ever. My problem with this model is that it really isn‚Äôt saying anything new because it‚Äôs not causative. I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious that when Bitcoin starts doing poorly, there will be more ‚Äúfear‚Äù in the market. Looking at the chart, it looks like the fear increases after major Bitcoin price crashes. Nothing new here. 

The general problem with reading news coverage, tweets, etc to measure fear is that by the time media responds, the price changes already have happened.

Edit: the methodology has a lot of potential and can provide useful information- I‚Äôm just cynical on its application to crypto or stock predictions. Which is not what the OP is saying, but I saw someone‚Äôs comment about how people could make trillions of dollars over this info lol Over the past few years Ive been collecting unstructured data (headlines, tweets, chats etc) on equities and crypto. Next to that Ive also build an engine that recognizes emotions and narratives in this data with the help of Machine Learning. From this ive constructed a time series (yellow line) that shows the level of fear in headlines, tweets, chatter etc. over time vs the return (for stationarity reasons) of Bitcoin. It is interesting to see how the two are related (especially the change in fear over time). I'm sorry but your chart sucks so bad your research is incomprehensible and your conclusion is lost in the mess

- colors too light to see
- similar colors for bar and line
- legend covers up y axis labels
- legend labels are garbage, not full words.
- legend colors don't really match chart series colors
- btc-usd series is really unclear what negative values mean
- chart title is really not explanatory
- almost identical colors used for several series
- several series not really identifiable on the chart What language did you build this on. I‚Äôm trying to do something similar and I‚Äôm wondering what tools you used and about any useful resources You‚Äôre sitting on a potential gold mine. Keep it to yourself and run with it So in the graph positive values mean positive sentiment and negative values represent negative sentiment? Could you also tell us what the appreciated words in the legend mean? I understand some but not all. Some more info would also be nice....what model did you use to build data? What are the results of the model? Etc.

How was the data selected to build the model? [removed] Good work, if you're using unlabelled data how are sure about the classification of your model? How come you opted for a lsmt followed by a random Forrest, would it not be easier to maybe focus on one model? What stops you from testing it? [deleted] [removed] I would make this business model for free during development. You would get a lot of feedback from the community to make this service great. Later than everybody will appreciate it and willingly to pay for it. [removed] Have you tried run it over the hype of 2017? 
There are many sentiment analysis tools that try to predict the price trend but alone they are very weak. It would interesting to compare your results to them, check out for example the one of TradingView.
What makes crypto unpredictable is whales behavior, they alone decide what the market should do, the sentiment is a consequence and long term price movement. So combining these different metrics could be interesting. When is the Uncertainty model coming out? I'm curious, is this a kind of ""cool garage project"", or is this a research conducted within some institution, be it academic or financial? Is there a publication (preprint) regarding the data? If you can make software monitor fear you in a way could be become Daredevil. I don't know if I'm reading that graph correctly, but it appears that BTC is trailing sentiment, which is just now turning positive.

Well, I'll say it right now: anybody who doesn't KNOW that BTC is going to multiply in value before year-end should stay well away from cryptos. what the hell is fear ? I dont invest in fear as long as i dont know it and stay at BTC meanwhile ... HOW MUCH? Hit me on ig Kungfumood This data helps to see whats going on in the market. Did you use some api to get all this social media info?

8,Bitcoin Price Rejects $52K Again ‚Äì Accumulation Phase Continues As Expected Over the Vacations,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/rrye6z/bitcoin_price_rejects_52k_again_accumulation/,"The two Christmas gifts that some people were hoping for did not arrive this year. The first was a $100K Bitcoin. The second was a more modest gift: for the price of Bitcoin to break through $52K resistance.

This almost happened in the days after Christmas, but a rejection took place with long positions liquidated. The price of Bitcoin hit the bottom of the range again at $46K. We will probably end the month around $48K.

This was something to be expected as we are in a vacation period where retail dictates the trend. We will have to wait for the return of the institutional investors next week for the trend to emerge from this range.

The more this accumulation range continues, the more aggressive the shakeouts will become, the more bearish the sentiment will be, and the more violent the next bullish wave will be in my opinion.

Nothing guaranteed as always, but a feeling I have right now and that I share with you in the last issue of In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter: [**https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/bitcoin-price-rejects-52k-again-accumulation**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/bitcoin-price-rejects-52k-again-accumulation)",78,63,True," I miss 2018/2019.

The idea is to provide an easy to use platform where users can get an idea of the market sentiment towards their favourite currencies. Currencies can be sorted by most positive/negative and by most mentions.

I‚Äôll be adding more functionality over the coming weeks, what‚Äôs up now was a little project I did over the weekend.

Doge: *Wow, very positive. So crypto.* Certainly an intriguing project and leaves me especially curious about how the algorithm is set to work. I find it interesting how on a day where RaiBlocks (NANO) is blasting off it has much more negativity apparently being thrown around than one would expect.  Does your sentiment dictionary include custom words that are only relevant to crypto sentiment? Eg: moon, hodl, Lambo, bags, fud, fomo etc? Good work. It's a pity that we don't see a strong correlation between positive sentiment and price Color me impressed. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre already planning on adding more cryptos to track and display data on?  will you allow historical data sets to be downloaded in spreadsheet format from here? If not I would be very interested in that feature if you could implement it. Very cool! Graphs are pretty neat. Thanks for sharing Could you add digibyte please? Great project! Nice work! Amazing! Is there a way to see further back than one week? Is the 0-100 scale normalised? Nice idea, bookmarked. Nice and clean. Like it Would love to see the source and understand how it decides what is neutral/positive/negative in order to better understand why it does so, if the function is correct this could seriously be great for investments, sentiment is one of the main factors that make people decide either hold or sell.

Curious as to if you used sentiment for each post/article as a whole document Vs. aggregating the sentiment of each mention of the coin per each article? Great site, but 8 Total Mentions for BTC?!

We see thousands of conversations about cryptocurrencies go around on the popular social media sites like twitter, reddit etc,where people give their opinions about the markets. 

Multiple times you must have seen when market goes down people start to talk about the bearish prices and when the market goes up, people start to talk about bullish prices, these people‚Äôs conversations/emotions on social media plays a major role in driving the prices.

Have you seen your favourite influencer tweeting about a coin and suddenly that coin goes 5-10% up? This is called sentiment, generally what happens is when an influencers tweet their sentiments among their audience then the audience follow blindly and buy that coin making that coin to increase in prices.

Basically a trader need to understand the psychology of the market, how a market runs,how sentiments can influence the market in positive as well as negative direction. A trader has to keep an eye on all the conversations on social media/news/tweets of influencers to keep up to date about the market, yeah it will consume a lot of your time to study the market but it's worth studying if you want to become a successful trader and want to minimize the risk of loss in trading.

I believe MATIC has nothing to prove now, it deserves to be among the top 10 cryptocurrencies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/rhseb1/this_is_why_polygon_is_one_of_my_favorite/,"The cryptocurrency market, unfortunately, is known for a high number of scams and frauds, especially because of projects that don‚Äôt act honestly with their community. At this point, I believe those who still get scammed probably don‚Äôt know much about crypto. I mean the top projects are easy to choose. Projects that care about their community and keep on an honest relationship with them are the ones to succeed and remain in the market for good time.

One of my favorite projects is Polygon. MATIC‚Äôs team for example, hasn‚Äôt failed its community, and what proved that was the implementation of their own EIP update after the community insisted on taking this step. Well it didn‚Äôt even hesitate to go for it as the community requested! I even see that Polygon is the most community focused project especially that it is offering us somehow zero fees for swift transactions! 

Polygon is truly leading the space with transactions and users. I believe this will benefit the entire space overall. Not to forget the growing fundamentals that seem to also be boosting the overall market sentiment for the blockchain project.

Also, blockchains now are some of the richest sources of verifiable data. And this is a big step towards improving developer access to datasets, and helping analysts unlock their immense latent value. What‚Äôs better than that? So after Polygon‚Äôs integration into Google‚Äôs BigQuery, one will be able to query their datasets, run analytics and extract insights.

We have a saying in my native town which says whoever preserves in something, will find what they‚Äôve been striving for. And whoever sows their seed, will reap its benefits. Can you relate?",50,74,False," [deleted] Not to get into a deep debate but using ""zero fees"" or "" community-focused"" as your main points is pretty weak sauce, I would say there are probably another 10 or so projects if not more hitting those sweet spots as well.

In the greater scheme of things, besides constant development and partnership. Unique use-case and delivering it to the common folk is what will make or break a project including ones that will sit in the TOp 10. The Google BigQuery connection also feel like one of those partnerships that is based on an agreement any blockchain can engage with Google and get onto the system with the right amount of money of course.

That being said im not here to shoot you down or Matic, as i do think Matic has its place in the market, but ive seen probably 20 posts today if not more about Matic and I'm starting to feel its a coordinated shilling attempt at this point. I have some MATIC but only a small stack and the reason for this is I don't fully trust the staying power of any individual side chain just yet and still am a bit fearful that if ETH solves their gas fee issue that poly becomes a less attractive offering overall.

exactly, MATIC should be in top 10 if not top 5 cryptocurrencies in the world, since Polygon is the index for all Ethereum scaling solutions, the industry‚Äôs leading zk powerhouse, making NFTs mainstream, offering unlimited support and the best infrastructure for developers to build their secure and fully functional dapps in an accelerated matter Matic has had a good run in the sun... it is in danger of becoming obselete over the next 12 months or so though....

Instead I would aim for smaller tokens in the market, like the Royal Falcons Club, with their unique strategy and operation mechanism.

8,Before 2022 will have the largest PnD the crypto market has ever seen.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/ph2caz/before_2022_will_have_the_largest_pnd_the_crypto/,"Comparing nowadays market with 2013/2017 we see very similar patterns arise. Hysteria is probably gonna break out sooner than later, and here is why.

NOTE: this is my personal, speculative view based on  pattern recognition and market sentiment. I'm not here to create any FUD/FOMO or whatever, even though I'm probably still getting flamed for it in the comments.

1. The marketing and creation of shitcoins is still on a contant rise. A LOT of new investors fall for fake promises from new projects, because they think it's the next new thing. This is ofcourse nothing new, BUT it won't slow down until we're starting to see red numbers again, and the shitcoin teams cannot afford to invest into marketing anymore.

2. ETH will most likely overtake BTC as crypto asset with the largest market cap. This is mostly derived from the fact that ETH is still by far the most utilised and adopted blockchain out there, and with continuous work from the dev team, that won't change anytime soon. If u take a look at the BTC dominance chart, I expect a similar pattern to that in 2017. When this hits the news a new wave of dumb money will shortly flow into the market, leading to large price volatility.

3. Looking at the market cycles, most technical analysts believe that BTC will climb to new ath's this year. Combine this with the fact that the BTC dominance will most likely keep dropping, altcois will soar when this happens.

4. When everyone thinks they can cash out soon and never have to work again, big corporations who have had a balanced portfolio since like forever (and basically control the market) will just dump on the average joe, leading to real FUD all over town, and ending the 2nd part of the 2021 bull run.

There are more points that I'm willing to discuss in the comments, but for now I've taken my shit, so it's time to go on with life.

Feel free to share your opinions and have a civilised discussion in the comments.",206,156,False," I hope you‚Äôre right

Another run up towards the end of the year would be amazing for everyone i'm guessing, we climb to 72k-80k we retest the ath, everyone screams ath and 100k, laser eyes and all that shit, we retrace complete euphoria kicks in and boom we crash, and everyone will scream buy the dip buy the dip. for me that's max pain [deleted] I don't understand #3, if BTC is climbing to new ATH's then how and why is BTC dominance dropping?

Edit: I'm not sure the people replying to this post understand this, but it's important to know that there's a significant difference between the current market conditions and the conditions when BTC is putting in new ATH's. Alts will take a backseat when BTC takes center stage, as they always have. I can't think of any reason why OP's assumption here would be correct, there isn't any historical data that shows this and no one that's replied to me has given really any solid basis for it. ETH is still in infancy and is prone to hacks and compromises, they fixed at least two critical bugs this year alone that could have destroyed its ecosystem. It‚Äôs still a high risk/volatile crypto. While it may surpass BTC in the next 5 years, it won‚Äôt be as stable.

Additionally, other coins that are rising up are bringing value(smart contracts, etc) and will make investors dip there hands in more than one pot. 

ETH will continue to be a big boi but there will be several other plays out there for a long time just like stocks. I agree Thank you, So what‚Äôs the correct move to make now to better my chances for profit? Why is SOL rocketing so much?

'The higher the level, the longer the fall', 'Invest wisely and never more than you're comfortable losing', Plus all those other sayings that are relevant. Regarding #4, you think there are enough average investors who are willing to sell to offset the big corporations and cause them to dump their holdings? Wouldn‚Äôt this basically mean the regular investors are the ones controlling the market more than corporations? I‚Äôd love to see a breakdown of % held by bug corporation vs % of ‚Äúwhales‚Äù to % of avg ppl holding less than a few $k. You had me until #2.  Every time I want to use ETH I get hit with a $200 gas fee.  No way is this thing taking #1 as things stand. I am ready daddy I agree with you on the continued rise of shit coins, but keep in mind that this is a rapidly evolving technology.

The new shitcoin is going to be NFT projects in the play to earn ecosystem.

8,Twitter Sentiment as Indicator for Shifting Sentiment,https://i.redd.it/wwb3dv9hx3f11.png,,8,11,False," What statistical methods have you used to objectify the correlation and time delay between the graphs? You make claims about correlation using only a few examples. From the text it seems like you‚Äôre just eyeballing the graphs and jumping to conclusions. The dip in prices past weeks was preceded by a change in sentiment weeks prior. This also was the case when the market dipped in june. Interestingly, sentiment also increased prior to the increases in price during the mid of June. Ive made several post on this topic, and I thought it would be interesting to share. Note that this is not a statement that the indicator always is correct in gauging future market movements, but combined with some common sense it does seem to be adding value.

In order to capture sentiment I created an algorithm which captures sentiment of all Tweets which cover Cryptocurrencies in order gain insight in to daily sentiment. The graph attached shows 3 plots namely, the level of sentiment, change in sentiment, and market cap of crypto's covered. For getting insight in to why prices move, the absolute level of sentiment is interesting, but mainly the change in sentiment is important.  The hypothesis is that if overall social media exposure is more negative compared to yesterday, people are more likely to sell, regardless of how positive or negative they are overall. This also is reflected in the bull/bear indicator, direction seems to be important (positive or negative) rather than the level.

I've wrote a more elaborate piece on the methodolgy on Medium (https://medium.com/@altcoinanalytic/beyond-conventional-indicators-a-study-of-twitter-sentiment-versus-crypto-prices-8870f5c788e5) in case one is interested. Moreover the indicator is updated every so often on AltcoinAnalytics.com, along with additional quantitative insights. Since replies are not showing up, I'll try to adress it this way. 
Currently I do not have enough data to test for statistical significance, so you are right in that respect. As mentioned in the post I do not claim that this is a magical predictor that signals every up or down tick. That said there seems to be some validity in using this as an indicator as the plot shows. Moreover, correlations are not the way to test this since that only would test the Co movement of the series. It would be more relevant to make long-short portfolios based on the indicator and test that for significant outperformance. When I have enough data I will test this. 
That said, again I want to stress that I see this as some interesting signal, do not interpret this as the holy grail for predicting crypto movements (surprise, there is none). And thanks for the comment  Ummm no correlation  As I try to explain, looking for correlations is completely useless. Correlation tells something about how to series move together, so in this respect at exactly the same time. You don't want to know this, you want to know if some variable signals before the other variable moves, correlation does not show that.

8,Dependent on BTC: Why Altcoins Follow Bitcoin?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/scbb5x/dependent_on_btc_why_altcoins_follow_bitcoin/,"Cryptocorrelation is a term used to describe the behavior of one cryptocurrency towards the behavior of another. Market analysts and experts discovered the first correlation between cryptocurrencies in 2017 when the collapse of Bitcoin led to the eventual drop in the capitalization of all other cryptocurrencies. The fact that Bitcoin jump-started the whole crypto industry has enabled it to have the final say regarding market sentiment. Additionally, traders and investors almost always check Bitcoin before deciding whether or not to sell their altcoin positions.

Simultaneously, there are times when a drop in Bitcoin‚Äôs value leads to a surge in an altcoin‚Äôs value. The most reasonable explanation for this is that investors will usually pull their capital out of Bitcoin investments and simply channel it to a promising altcoin. This action leads to a fundamental increase in the particular altcoin. Additionally, a promising altcoin that receives market hype, is capable of experiencing a bull-run all on its own. Therefore, it isn‚Äôt entirely true that all altcoins depend on Bitcoin.   
But for instance, every single time the price of Bitcoin rises, the price of altcoins rises as well. But why does this happen?

**TLDR**:

Option contracts are a way to hedge against volatility (price movement) in the market. Other ways include futures contract and swapping.

In general, higher volatility means higher risk because prices move more. That affects people's demand for option prices. Form options contracts, we can also tell how bullish or bearish the market is.

**Get smart:** Options are a tool that can be used to hedge against risks or to bet in the market. Difficult tool, but powerful when used right.

**Get smarter:** CeFi options for crypto exists. And DeFi options protocols are coming right up.

# General Conclusion

2 types of volatility ‚Äî external volatility (aka market) and implied volatility (aka internal). They are useful factors when understanding your assets.

Volatility is not the only thing you should care about when looking at your (crypto) assets. Also note the other data and factors.

* Micro Economy: Inflation of assets
* Macro Ecosystem: Market Conditions. Market could change and that affects the assets.
* Past Data: Beyond micro and macro markets it's also good to look at historical data to look at past data to get some reference and understanding. Note: *Past data does not define future performance*

**Historical Volatility vs Implied Volatility**

There are two types of volatility. One is the market volatility and the other is implied volatility. In a very simple way it's basically historical volatility and future volatility.

**Historical volatility:** It is based on past data and on all the information that is already given.

**Future volatility:** It is based on people's expectations of the assets and here you calculate based on how people pay for the expected assets.

**Higher Volatility = Higher Risk**

The general notion about volatility is that higher volatility = high risk.

Sometimes it is called educated gambling or educated speculation but **it's not always true**. The general notion of higher volatility means that the price will move more and when the prices move more, higher risk will be experienced. But it really depends on the trading strategy because that will help to mitigate different risks as when you have something with high volatility you can do something else to try and offset the risk or try to reduce that risk.

# What is Market Volatility?

>It's a statistical measure of how ""spread"" is the value from the middle average. More spread (like a pancake) means higher volatility. Less spread (like a mountain) means lower volatilty.

1. **Uses Past Data:** It's historical volatility or using past data to get some understanding of where the asset is right now.
2. **Fluctuation of Returns:** It is the fluctuation (movement) of the returns of the prices of the assets. It is measured by measuring the spread of the returns so you can think of it as two bell curves. One bell curve is flat so almost like a very low middle line and it spreads out very widely like a pancake. You have another bell curve like the Mount Everest so it has a very high peak and everything is very narrow towards the peak.

 

**Why do we care?**

These values give us two main information:

1. **Market sentiment:** It¬†is something like the better volatility where we try to figure out what the market is thinking about and how it compares to other assets
2. **Historical spot price:** It is how the asset itself is doing

We use the information to make bets with it or to hedge against the future",1,17,False,,0.0

Shocking! No $10k is a good entry point for BTC At least he has no self interest in ppl holding up the price... üòè Yeah, let‚Äôs forget about all those guys that lost their shirts. Get in now! So he‚Äôs saying that past performance guarantees future results?  Got it. Guys please buy this bag, we‚Äôve been so patient this whole time bby please just buy the bag His face says otherwise Or wait for it to drop more I thought the universal maxim was don‚Äôt try to time the market. I disagree, $5k~$10k is a good entry point. Everything is oversold right now. Even the US Dollar is going back up. To be honest, I can't even imagine how much usdt it will cost in a month go on, pump it! This motherf*cker. Has he been liquidated yet? MS needs you to buy in now so he doesnt get more margin calls. Michael J. Saylor is absolutely right. Many complained that they missed the Bitcoin opportunity when its price was $69K in November 2021.

Now they have another opportunity to climb aboard the revolutionary train that aims to return power over money to the people.

And what do these people do? They let fear rule them!

Instead of acting with logical reasoning, these people let their emotions guide their choices. These are the same people who will express regret in the future when the price of Bitcoin rises above $100K.

The opportunities are the same for everyone with Bitcoin. The difference is that some people take them, while others choose not to, preferring to have regrets later. No it‚Äôs not Fuck all the way off. ‚Äú if you don‚Äôt sell it can‚Äôt lose value‚Äù. Whistles past the graveyard. I decided that I am never going to invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum again. If you look at conmarketcap you will find that the top 10 cryptos change drastically every year. A lot of projects are about to be kicked out of the top 10 now due to the recent dump and new ones will replace them. I see NEAR replacing SOL and CNDL replacing BNB once Binance is officially sued by the SEC. Makes me think he bought most of his BTC because he was FOMO'ing, like he literally thought it was going to 100k-1Million.   


Now would have been the best time for Microstrategy to buy in, and Tesla etc, but even the big boys got that fomo. ha Sayle of the century After the housing market collapses. That is the ideal moment. THERE IS NO SECOND BEST! So much pumping. Nah, the ideal entry point is 2 weeks from now, when BTC hits $5k Not $12k?

9,Cryptocurrency Bear Market: Strategies of a Smart Investor,https://www.cryptohopper.com/blog/6787-cryptocurrency-bear-market-strategies-of-a-smart-investor?atid=15567,,13,27,False," Diversification of assets among multiple yield protocols is one of the best strategies for generating huge returns. There are other platforms for this, but I feel Spool is the best at the present because it involves the automatic channeling of funds among multiple yield aggregators, resulting in a risk-managed ecosystem for the stable coins deposited in its spools. It may not be the optimal strategy, but I believe that buying the dip now will provide a lot of people with good profits once the bullrun begins, especially if you focus on low market cap tokens. Due to discussions regarding regulations, the recent downturn in the crypto market has given traction to certain projects, such as RAIL, XMR, and SCRT, and has led me to see potential in them. I've been keeping an eye on these privacy protocols, though Railgun stands out because of its multichain features and delivery of complete privacy utility, but they're all privacy protocols with potential, so buying the dip is a good option as well. I think that smart investors are buying now, if you look at the statistics, the whales are now buying BTC LINK and other coins  
  
But NFT also bring money on bear market, Troll Town NFT collection was free, some NFT were sold at 5-20 ETH, AngelBlock mint price was 0.069 ETH , now some already sold at 2-4 ETH which is also very cool Cool article and great strategies, especially buying the dips and going for blue chips; ETH, OCEAN, CTSI, and DIA to name a few. If you have noticed, these projects are focused on building right now, I believe they will take off once we are past this bear market. I think I'm doing it right by buying the dip and going for blue chips like ETH, MATIC, OCEAN and FTM. Hoping to see them melt faces once the bear market is over. This is the best time to get in as NFTs are the hot topic currently and the demand is massive. Everyone is joining the party like legendary driver Ayrton Senna's f1 car NFT collection hosted by AXL INU. Its best to catch them early otherwise the price might rise to astronomical heights. Put simply, smart investors are buying the dip and staking cryptos like Celo and ICP during this downturn. You can't predict the market so just buy the dip and stake. That's what I do and I'm doing well. The smartest way is to keep things simple, in my opinion. Set it once and forget it in low risk spools while the auto compounder does the rest. There are just too many uncertainties lying around",0.9975

9,Small Account Challenge - Week 2 Roundup - 130% Portfolio Gain - Strategy and Lessons learned so far!!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/ukgtrj/small_account_challenge_week_2_roundup_130/,"**NOTE: While i am aware that the challenge itself is stocks and not crypto, everything outlined in here, works for crypto these are genral trading trading rules.**

Hey all,

Welcome to the 9th day of the $1k to $10k Challenge, where I daytrade my way to $10k.

A few notes before the update:

1. I'm using a cash account to avoid PDT
2. I mostly day trade 0DTE QQQ options, but not opposed to any opportunity that comes up
3. I use Support/Resistances, VWAP, 50/200 MA, and RSI to daytrade.
4. I use the 1-minute chart

**Challenge Overview**

2 weeks in and we are up 130%, this is beyond amazing! No longer do i  have to do 1 contract per trade. I swear you dont know how much this  means, till you lose it.So normally i give a daily breakdown, but i  thought i would collect all the questions i have been asked on Reddit  and Discord and create a sort of FAQ that everyone could refer to, if  need be. Please note non of this is financial advice and im by no means  the best trader but i do well enough to live off trading. But before we  start here is the obligatory account update.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b3ow1sczx2y81.jpg?width=368&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3922bcec3c093d4235e6ec51d16ec6ed94aaea0b

**What is the Setup I Use?**

Let's  go over my trading setup since I have been asked about that . Now I  like to keep things super simple, I'm not a fan of a million screens and  indicators.

* I use TradingView for charting, on that, I have RSI, VWAP, 50/200 MA, and Volume Profile loaded up.
* I  use IKBR as my broker and use the mobile app so I can look at my screen  for the chart and my phone to order, I just got used to this setup but  you can TradeStation or a different broker, whatever you are really  comfortable with, it doesn't make much of a difference.
* While  they haven't come into play yet but I also use Unusual Whales for  Options Flow and IKBR or TD Ameritrade for Order Flow and L2

Again  this is my personal preference, you should use whatever makes you the  most comfortable and can help get the most information and place trades  quickly. But since I have been asked here it is.

**How to find Good Entries/Exits, how do I make sure my green trades don't turn red?**

I'm  sure this scenario happened to you, it happened to me a lot and I get  asked this a lot in the discord. Your stop loss hits and then it runs.  Feels like the MMs have something personal against you right.This  happens because your entries are bad If you enter close to the bottom  (or top for puts) you are less likely to hit your stop loss. Easier said  than done right? WRONG. All you need is to know some trading basics  here are some:

A  support/resistance will ALMOST ALWAYS be retested. So let's say support  is at $307 on QQQ, and it breaks it. Don't go long yet, wait a bit it  will go past resistance. And then go back to test $307 again, it could  happen once or twice. Then it will either make a move up or down from  here. NOW YOU HAVE A CLEAR DIRECTION, if it breaks through $307 again,  this is where you go long and place your stop loss 10% or 20% or  whatever your number is below resistance. 

Now, do you know why your stop  losses hit? I'll make it simpler, it breaks $307. It's at $308 now, you  pick up calls with 20% stop loss, it goes down to retest $307 and goes  down some probably $306.5 your call are down 20%, your stop loss hits,  the pullback is done, the stock breaks through $307 and runs to $310.  You are posting loss porn on reddit and crying about it. Do this and  this will almost never happen to you again.

VWAP  and 50/200 MA are your friends. They act as support and resistance. So  if the stock just broke through resistance and is running the next stop  before the next resistance is probably one of these. This is a good time  to either trim or exit your position. 

What I do is get 50% out and move my stop loss to entry or a little above it. Now I apply what I wrote  above and wait for the retest if it runs again after the retest you can  move your stops to VWAP/50/200 MA. If it fails get out or let it hit the  stop your call, either way now your profitable trades won't turn into  losers.

**How to Place Stop losses, how to avoid 1 bad trade taking down 10 good ones?**

I'm  more often right than wrong, during this challenge i only had 1 red day  and on that day only 1 red trade that took down the day out of 3  trades. I had 3 red trades in total during this journey. The combined  losses of these 3 trades are around $550. I could have been up another  505% not including the compounding effect from these, if i managed my  losses better. My stop losses sucked. I mean sucked hard. I now got a  lot better at this. Here is how I remedied this and how you can too.

I  see a lot of people pick a stop loss % out of thin air, 20% for example  as I did. While this is all good and well. I found that having my stop  losses at events made things a lot easier. For example, if the stock  broke support, retested, and then fell again. This is a good time to cut  a loser. Or if the trend changes etc ‚Ä¶. If your plan fails, what's  holding on to the stock any longer going to do, at this point, you are  hoping it will bounce back, this is pure luck and/or gambling.

**How do I Position Size?**

This  is something I struggled with at the beginning of the challenge. I'm  used to trading with the main account, making $20 per trade was not  something I was used to, so I slammed full port into 0DTE or next-day  contracts. Very bad Idea. Don't ever do that. You can be right 9 times.  All it takes is one time. You cant average down and losses are huge. 25%  is my preferred size, which is still a bit high (5-10% is best). As the  account grows I'm able to do more, I have multiple contracts so I can  take starter positions and trim. So the solution here is simple, be  patient, do the boring thing so you can do the fun thing later.

\*\*What  is the strategy I use?\*\*The name of the game here is confirmations, all  trading really is at its core is finding as many supporting signs that  give you a direction on where the stock is going. All we can do is find  as many signs as possible to support either a bullish or bearish thesis.  That's it, that's really all trading is, all strategies are built  around that, once you understand that you can make your own strategies  and pick your stocks.

So the  strategy I have been using so far is just that. Now as a rule of thumb  you don't want to be trading against the trend, if the market is going  up you want to be trading calls and puts if it's trending down.

What I do is basically a combination of everything i wrote in the post so far. So for example if

* The stock is at support, pulled back, and broke through support again
* The stock price is below VWAP, 50MA, and 200MA
* There is bearish flow coming in
* RSI is oversold (doubt that happens, if the first 3 are true, but just giving an example)

4 confirmations are telling me, its time to buy puts.

Now  nothing works every time, but I guarantee you that in situations like  the one above more often than not you will be right, combine that with  the risk management outlined above and good entries/exits I don't really  see how you cant be profitable. You

There  are a ton of additional confirmations out there, news, catalysts, L2/L3  (order flow), RSI, MACD, each to his own. The main idea is to have as  many confirmations as you can. Could be as little as 2 but the more you  have, the more likely your trade is going to be profitable.

For  some this stuff is basic, for others its not. But i do know that are  ‚Äúgurus‚Äù out there who charge $xxxx for this stuff. Now you have the  knowledge and you can pick your own stocks using these setups.

I  have got nothing to sell you, and i plan on writing more stuff like  this in the future if enough people like it, so if you gained anything  from this or enjoyed all i ask is please join my sub [r/theashshow](https://www.reddit.com/r/theashshow/) and if you want learn or talk about stocks do hop into my free discord server.

I am very good at not doing stuff. what a load of crap, in bitcoin we trust ultra cringe, did they kick you out of scientology and thats why your here? HODLING is literally the single easiest strategy of all possible strategies. most people struggle with selling and taking profits.

get past your emotion  ... but  simultaneously dont forget to play a bit cult and worship Bitcoin like a deity lmao When dealing with any assets it‚Äôs best to keep emotions out. The only fundamental of Bitcoin worth focusing on is market share. Bitcoin is huge and some argue too big to fail. Other than that? One hour block confirmation time? Huge transaction fees (for small amounts)? 7 transactions per second? If a coin like this came out today, it would be labeled a shitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public dispersed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique in that there are a finite number of them: 21 million.

Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted bitcoin as payment.

The underlying Bitcoin protocol is deflationary because the supply of bitcoins grows at a diminishing rate. The result is that the purchasing power of bitcoins increases over time. Bitcoins may be lost, but they will never be devalued.

Bitcoin is often described Holding is not the best strategically. This is not debatable, it‚Äôs mathematically incorrect. It‚Äôs not even the best safe strategy. It will make you money though.

Holding has never been, and will never be, the best strategy. Not an opinion thing. Pretty easy - Bitcoin is going to $100k - the pattern repeats, everything in between is just noise. Ignore it and HODL. Holding is much more fun when you‚Äôre a miner, keeps growing! [deleted] I would have done way better if I just held my USDC, personally. I sold before the crash got big, then bought in again right before it did‚Ä¶ Hodling is just Hodling not the best strategy

Accumulation of BTC is greater than Hodling Honestly, I struggle with selling, not holding.

Holding is easy, I just throw my ledger out the window. To hodle all you have to do is buy and forget. What‚Äôs so hard about that? Defining local and major tops, taking profits on the way up and estimating the dips to buy back in to accumulate more coin is much harder and too hard for a lot of people because it requires time, knowledge and research. If you really want to HODL get a Nano S and periodically send your BTC to it.  It is just enough of a hassle to transfer it out, but not *too* much of a hassle if you must.. Amazing company with alot of expert and experience team and in this project alot of invester are come here without see the has roadmap.This is one of the most promising and high standard project.This project has great future It's better to keep emotions at bay when dealing with any assets.

9,The BTC dip with Strategy: Stable coin minting,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/t217ix/the_btc_dip_with_strategy_stable_coin_minting/,"Bitcoin value has risen by about $5000 in the last few days placing its current value at roughly 39,500USD. This is good news for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Enthusiasts expect this value to drop even further in the next few days.  While this is a good time to buy BTC, there might be another strategy to employ during this period of uncertainty. This way is referred to as Stable Coin Minting. 


Stablecoin minting involves investing in the creation of new stable coins through a process called staking. The advantage of this type of investment is that the value of stable coins does not fluctuate with the rise or dip in the value of other coins but is rather fixed on the value of assets outside the crypto ecosystem. 

A good example is $USDT fixed to the value of the US dollar. Also, a significantly high amount of profit is generated in the form of transaction fees paid by the system users. 


Combing the stability of stable coins and the profitability of minting can be very low risk and few blockchain platforms like Konstellation.tech offer this service.",19,13,False," Does this enable all forms of minting?

I was expecting to make much more considering people are making 10x overnight. 

Which is why i decided to take a different approach and invest in governance tokens like BitDAO‚Äôs $BIT, that allows me to vote on project proposals, and have access to the world‚Äôs largest DAO directed treasury that‚Äôs being used to support developers in building their inn projects. 

Holding such tokens basically means that i have unlimited opportunities to invest early in projects with fundamentals and potential. 

Let me know what you guys think and if my decision is logical.",3,32,False," I suspect that you might have unrealistic expectations... Dude, you are dreaming, almost nobody does a x10, and most of people who do it loose it gambling again in the crash... be smart and be happy with 10/50% a year, think of yourself lucky if you do more. And when I talk about profits, I talk about actually profit, on your bank account in real money. What you do isn't smart with the current crypto and traditional market condition, when this will crash really hard, you will loose almost everything. Don't chase x10, chase consistency, that's the only way you will actually make $$# How long did you try out the different strategies? HODLing is not a short term strategy. If you haven't held for five years you're not doing it right I‚Äôll admit right now that I don‚Äôt know anything about governance tokens, so won‚Äôt comment on whether or not your plan for those is valid. Maybe I‚Äôll explore those. I‚Äôm just wondering how long you really gave alts, memes etc. a solid try. Sure, you see people brag about 10xing in a week or whatever. But maybe that‚Äôs just what they say to hype their token. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

I‚Äôve made bigger $ with 2 out of 5 of mine but I‚Äôve also stayed with those 2 projects since last Sept. Got in at the launch of ArchAngel and I‚Äôm def staying for what they‚Äôre building. Saita needs to get their house in order, but I‚Äôll stay there for now b/c I‚Äôm still up. The rest are young but with utility and purpose. My point, it takes time to build something real. Once you find that kind of legitimate project, you hold. The easiest way to 10x or more is to get into a project as early as possible, then have the patience and guts to hold through all the ups and downs.  2021 gave way to many people false hope of lambo's and becoming millionaires overnight with a $500 investment, but that just isn't how this stuff works....

Thus, my recommendation is to diversify your portfolio.  Pick up a good % of established coins.  Over time you will gain profit there, and you can increase that with staking and LP's.  Then if you really want to get a potential moon shot, do some research and find a new project where you can get in early and invest with confidence that's it's not a rug or honeypot.  Ideally the project will be more than a meme coin and have/be developing real utility in the crypto space.  Archangel is one you look at.  They are early, but they are developing an entire ecosystem of tokens through collaboration with different dev teams.  You could get into Archangel early, but all the other upcoming tokens day 1.  This is my current moon shot. Industrial real estate REIT
Farm real estate REIT
Large cap etf Buy and hold. Thanks me in 5 years. If you want to get rich faster than that, start your own business or get a better job. Hodl Check out what Dinger is working on, a launchpad for meme coins with safety utilities where you get to vote to pull out everybody's value if you think the creators are doing something sus. People who make that overnight 10x are literally gambling, and it's just very small number of them. It can take months for solid FA projects to even go 500%.

I don't think the run of gaming coins have ended though, but may be delayed. Free to play ones like Guild of Guardians, Monster Galaxy are still promising in my opinion. Might take time to have their run though, but that's where patience comes in. A project where you have the ability to vote? Opportunities to invest early? It almost sounds like your talking about ARCHA. A coin where the public voice means something. Being a holder of ARCHA gives you the inside scoop on upcoming pressles within the ecosystem and staking benefits... 2 more projects releasing in the ecosystem this quarter ICP, did me alright for a bit but now I'm in on ARCHA too!",0.9982

9,Staking stablecoins is one of the safest and most profitable forms of passive income.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/umf8d4/staking_stablecoins_is_one_of_the_safest_and_most/,"During this crash, I learned this the hard way. People with a huge amount of stablecoins staked didn't seem to notice anything and didn't panic as much as others. Now I'm not going to put most of my crypto investments into stablecoins, but it would be good to know that a portion of my worth isn't wiped out with each dip.

Here are some of the platforms I recommend. All of these are very safe in my opinion, and you can lower your risk by dividing your entire sum among different platforms: [Haru Invest](https://haruinvest.com/), [Nexo](https://nexo.io/) and [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/).

Stablecoins can earn up a good amount of APY% on these platforms. Would be a great investment to sleep on for a few years and get passive income.",133,97,False,"  \+1 for Haru. I used their platform for staking my USDT for up to 15% APR with lockup. They don‚Äôt use a lending-borrowing model like other CeFi firms like Nexo and Celsius. Instead, they provide high APR through high frequency algorithmic trading with minimal risk strategies. Say that to everyone with locked staking in ust right now Normally I'd agree with you and people should be have some farming or LP coverage in their portfolio. But, stable coins aren't immune to issue. Just look at UST, it's still unpegged. It's a stable coin that is sitting at 0.89 went down to .62 yesterday. Voyager offers a 9.0% APY on USDC, which appears to be quite competitive. This is a joke about UST right? God I hope so lol Providing it isn‚Äôt UST, why people stake some absolute shitcoin stables, when 1-1 collateralised real time third party attestation coins exist, baffles me. You‚Äôre doing it to yourself at that stage. To be honest, I've been thinking of doing this myself for the past month, shifting money from my own bank account, which is yielding nothing, and buying stable coins and staking them. I already do that with other Alt coins, so I might as well use my general account to accomplish this. Spool's original middleware offers some good passive income. From the protocol's premise, where deposits are automatically routed via several yield generators with pre-set risk tolerance and restrictions, a large APY with managed risk can be expected. Dont forget thst diverisfying your assets also applies to stablecoins.

Diversify between all stablecoins and also between platforms.

Dont use  one stablecoin on one platform
Dont use one stablecoin on several platforms
Dont use several stablecoins on one platform.

Have several stablecoins on several different platforms. Easy.

You can easily find a list i personally use 6 different platforms, some more knowm than others and some more risky.

Also most platforms offer a sign up bonus when using a referal, sometimes up  50$ for amou ts below 1k $. Stablecoins is the safest way to make money in crypto. Ever heard of UST? Haru looks like the only thing worth investing in. It feels like Blockfi really just wants $3M+ clients to stake, and I cant find any staking nexo. It seems like it's just a kraken competitor, one I've never heard of but am interested in nonetheless.

Do you do anything else on nexo? Have you not seen UST ? Unless its UST lol I concur.

I stake USDC on crypto.com ha.  you say this immediately after UST depegs, which is the one major scenario that blows up your ""safe"" and ""profitable"" passive income.

Yes, under normal operations, it's very very attractive.  But buyer beware... With the current state of the market, having an alternative means of creating passive income is essential. Because no one knows what will happen next, and from the look of things the passive income system developed by Spool will make it much easier to avoid risk and earn reasonably while the market is down. Don‚Äôt buy UST please The only thing about this that I advise is to diversify into stables. Not one single stable is complete immune from depegging and you need to spread risk as to not get rekt.

You also need to keep an eye during days of market volatility. We had problems in the past with frax, yesterday was UST. The market will soon or later test their peg. Xusd is the one Any profits I take into USDT I immediately put into various platforms to earn interest on while they sit in the side waiting to be reinvested back into dips like we have now. 

In fact I have one platform I get 11% on USDT and 5.5% on ETH and have moved all my ETH trading there, so whatever I'm holding between the two makes me passive money while I'm trading back and forth between the two. Staking is a great way to get passive income. You just lock in and wait for the sweet rewards to mount. I'm staking with $IXS currently. They're based on the ETH blockchain, but they're experimenting with other blockchains like Polygon. Definitely worth checking out. EEUR pool has been my saving grace in this market. I don't have to worry about de-pegging as well as it's backed by bank reserve and government bonds

H2O is another win for me. Ocean protocol backed stablecoins for ocean data marketplace

I held UST during this period well I don't regret it, it gave me good gains careful, only works safely for centralized stablecoins that have backing by companies, otherwise those stables risk to spiral into hell.

each has their own risk, as long as youre diversified even in stablecoins you should come out in a win

I think though staking them on Dexes is best, in LP pools or lending since they are sustainable rates from volume and others that trade, like on AlgoFi,Uniswap or kdx

They are not artificial or loans from banks to be given, just math calculations where the house wins but it also doesnt risk going under Anchor protocol has a 19% for stablecoins. Is it long-term viable? No. However, it would remain at 19% until they ran out of yield reserves, at which point it would drop to roughly 15%. My favorite among stable coins is Tether. This is a stable coin that has successfully proven itself among traders. the problem that remains, what will happen to our coins if we wake up and find these platforms run out of business. I would include Hodlnaut on your staking list... I‚Äôve come to realize a while ago that Nexo is good for Stablecoins, although people might consider the 12% APY very low, but it‚Äôs safe and consistent, Yield app is also another app like that with a slightly higher APY, depending on the number of YLD you hold.

Using Kalmar to farm BUSD as a single asset sure does have it pecks too, with about 20%-50% APY and Kalmar also provides leverage, basically earning passive income on Stablecoins in this market is the right place to be. Spool: Built for the bear

The APY rates being generated based on the yield strategies in the genesis spools that went live last week is enough reason to see why it's more reasonable to adopt diversified yield farming with stablecoins as a strategy for passive income in a bear period like this. Over $65M staked in the pools in less than 2 weeks already indicates that many people have realized what really pays under this current market condition. So true! Stablecoin is great during bearmarket. DCA into your solid projects. I'm keeping my stables for FLD TGE for now. FLUID intends to significantly disrupt the way liquidity works in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Ethereum looks cheap, too. Enjoy the sales! I've been staking PaxG. I wanted to buy some gold for my portfolio and this made the most sense. Staking with stablecoins seemed impossible few years ago but there we go, earning passively on coins that don't change prices due to market crashes. Feels good to stake USDT & USDC on GreenHouse at ~20% APY, also staking BUSD on Donkey Finance. My stables are on Greenhouse dex farming at like 20% and then some tokens like DAFI ATOM are staked as well. I never understood why you guys, when presented with the opportunity to make life changing wealth, instead opt to invest in dog coins and stablecoins. Invest in projects with world changing utility, like XRP and ICP. I was using NEXO for some time as well but I didn't like the amount of centralization. I have more trust in YieldApp when it comes to staking. You can also consider lending as a source of passive income with your stablecoins. I'm satisfied with APYs on Kalmar right now. Passive income makes me forget about this dip, at least a bit. Its true right now but things would change once Honeyland comes in. Honeyland is a strategy and resource management game, open ecosystem and decentralized exchange where developers and studios build tools, games, items and more into the platform that allows for infinite gaming experience. All these features are money-makers of tomorrow ! I'm happy you learned. I have been doing this from the begging of the year myself, preparing for a time like this. Although I use Tetu for stablecoin staking & farming.

All I do now is to claim my yield and sell them into stablecoins, then buy the dips on my biggest bags; DIA, chainlink, etc.

I think with this strategy, I'll be in the market for a very long time. We also offer about 36% to 250% APY when users stake on our platform In the light of the latest events on UST, I think staking algo-backed stablecoins is out of the question for the majority of us from the crypto universe now. 

My way is to stake solid coins with big potential for rise, NGM, OCEAN, H2O... 

If I am not protected by stablecoins peg, what's the reason to lose rising gains from my staked coins? Yes and no, specially as stablecoins aren't that stable this days...  


The lesson I learnt after taking an huge hit on my UST/BUSD farming on kalmar is that great diversification is also really important on stablecoins and higher yields also mean higher risk  


Still farming and staking of stable coins is also a great practice, but as again:  
Diversify diversify diversify! Fuck this post.",0.9998

And when it comes to keeping my digital assets safe, I‚Äôm using Vault12 where I‚Äôm able to recover, back up, and provide legacy inheritance for all my digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFTs, other cryptocurrencies, private keys, seed phrases, PIN codes, digital art, and of course, my crypto wallets.

One simply need to think fast to stay safe in the crypto space. Currently focused on staking on Unifarm as they can boast of juicy pools, currently on the DVDX pool as it offers 36%APY. My stay safe strategy is simple. 
I diversify into multiple coins  with good use cases.  It helps my get a piece of em all.

Also looking to diversify into staking pools too. But am waiting for spool launch since it‚Äôll be easier to use and with their buffer system, fees will be minimal What I do is to make sure my seed phrase are kept safe but also with a family member that I trust. 

About hedging funds, I keep all profits in OUSD, a stablecoin that earns yield while having it sir in my wallet 

For future investment, I'm keeping funds in ETH, MATIC,  NAKA, OGN, NII, BNB and just little in some memecoin. It's a brilliant option with your hedging funds strategy. However, you'll just need to be sure you're on the right asset management platform to help you out with the funds and crypto asset management. In particular I'll suggest it's a self-custodial crypto banking or asset management platform like that of Fireblocks, UnidoEP, Metamask Insto and others Diversification has been a successful strategy for me due to the high volatility nature of the crypto market, and It is always prudent to select different tokens with different use cases and projects, as I did with FTM for my DeFi token, NII and LRC for my L2 tokens, and SAND and RIDE for my gaming tokens.

It‚Äôs the distribution phase of Wcykoff‚Äôs cycle. Whales have to liquidate eventually to take profits. So they do it when retail sellers are overleveraged. In doing so, they cash out their bags they‚Äôve accumulated and can re-accumulate at a lower price. Because retail‚Äôs overleveraged, they get liquidated, which further drives the price down, as well as short-selling + shaking out paper hands along the way. Then, when the leverage traders and paper hands are shaken out, whales can finally buy back in, restarting the pump and dump (‚Äúacquisition + distribution‚Äù) cycle. Look up a video on the Wyckoff Market Cycle if you still don‚Äôt get it. The cycle enables whales to make profits on the way up and on the way down. We retail traders are just along for the ride.

**TLDR**: Strategies are presented here to create basic positions from which you can explore other new strategies. As mentioned, options strategies allow the creation of positions with the risk aversion level from the investor's demands. Using the strategy as a hedge, it is necessary to consider whether your position is suitable or not.

**Get smarter:** Not any asset has options based on it. However, we can design our own to make contracts that closely resembles an asset we hold with another asset. Of course, the complexity and number of transactions also increase, they reduce profit by cost.

# General Conclusion

One of the most attractive feature of options is that it can be a combination of options or combined with other derivatives to create a variety of strategies. The possibilities for profit can be so varied that almost any investor can find a strategy that meets their preferred level of risk and is in line with the market forecast.

Without options, the strategies are very limited. If the assets are expected to increase, people would buy the stocks; if they are expected to decrease, people would sell them. Choice makes the move from forecasting to a profitable action plan, if the forecast is correct. Of course, the strategy will punish you for incorrect prediction. However, with the correct use of options, the punishment will be quite small and predictable.

In this newsletter, we will introduce some simple option strategies that you can apply easily. These strategies are the easiest to understand and require the least transaction.

# Covered Call Option strategy

>**TLDR:** I have $ETH. I sell options for $ETH so people can buy $ETH when prices increase. I get money upfront. I lose the infinite upside.

## Who will use this strategy?

### Own Asset

You have people who own the asset, say $ETH. In crypto space, we have two types of people. The first type is people who just have $ETH as an investment and keep it in their wallets. I'm looking at you, institutional investors.

The second type is people who are liquidity providers to protocols like HEGIC, OPYN.

### Sell Call Option

For people who are liquidity providers, this is where you will be selling a call option.

Crash course: call option is basically the ability for someone else to buy your ETH. You're selling the possibility for someone to buy this asset (ETH) from you at a different price.

### Example

Let's say ETH right now is worth $1800 and you want to sell this call option. The strike price is $1950 and they have to pay a premium of $100. Let's say ETH becomes $2200.

Because someone bought the call option from you, they can go to you and buy at $1950 because you've already made a promise. The benefit for you is that you received this $100 premium no matter what. This premium is why people want to be option sellers as they get to earn some money.

### How does this strategy help to manage risk?

This is money upfront whether ETH goes to $2200 or ETH drops to $1000. Whatever happens to ETH doesn't matter because I have this $100 upfront.

Index investing is a passive approach to investing. It attempts to generate returns like a broad market index. The involves using a buy-and-hold strategy to replicate the performance of a specific index (which could be an equity or fixed-income index) by purchasing the component securities of the index. ...

The resultant effect of this method of investing is lower management fees and expense ratios (ERs) when compared with actively managed investments. Another benefit of index investment is tax-efficiency, and this is due to fewer number of trades done in comparison to actively managed investments. Index investing is also an effective method of diversifying against risks, hence, its characteristic low risk. 
Blockchain has brought about the creation of several valuable digital assets. Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins are good examples.  Due to the meteoric rise in the value of these coins in recent years, digital assets have become quite a lucrative portfolio for index investing. However, there is an issue of inadequate understanding of the crypto space. To solve this problem and make index investing on digital assets a lot easier, investors should leverage on platforms with the substantial expertise and insight into the crypto space as well as a solid knowledge and experience in index investing to guarantee profit. Beyond the ease, 

it is also less risky. Several platforms offer good ROI, but it is my opinion that Konstellation‚Äôs VegaX is worth considering because of its hassle-free user interface and excellent ROI (Over 30%).

It goes without saying that I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I've been playing with crypto only since march of 2020, and I'm not an expert by any means. But lately, I've been following this strategy and it mostly has turned out well.

So here's the strategy:

1. I normally hold BTC and ETH.
2. I constantly check the prices of other, relatively Lindy, and high-quality assets such as Litecoin or Chainlink.
3. When the prices of LTC or LINK plummet relatively to BTC and ETH (as they do often) I sell some of my BTC/ETH to buy Litecoin or Chainlink.
4. I hold the altcoins for a while and when they go up in price relative to BTC/ETH I swap them for the latter coins.

I'm not saying this is an optimal strategy, but it seems to have worked relatively well for me. I plan to keep doing this for a few months. Later, when the price of Bitcoin reaches 80.000, I'll start slowly converting my gains into other assets (thinking about stablecoins, PaxGold, and stocks).

So what do you think about this strategy? I would appreciate it if you helped me refine and improve it.

Thank you very much!",3,15,False," Generally I would advice against trading crypto. Every time you exchange BTC/ETH for another asset you have to realize gains which incurs a taxable event as well as pay fees and spreads associated with your exchange.

Following the trend is something that most of cryptocurrency investors do. You can call it a common issue if you want, and I believe that all of us have done that at least once. One of the biggest trends right now in the cryptocurrency sphere is DAOs. These organizations are getting a huge appreciation and recognition, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that all DAOs are going to be successful, does it?

DAOs do usually raise funds to achieve a set of targets or to invest in a specific industry, but raising funds isn‚Äôt enough. I mean for a DAO to be prosperous, it has to combine a strong treasury with other characteristics, such as clear goals and plans, well reputation, and the flexibility during different market conditions. BitDAO for example, has been one of the most recognizable DAOs in the market recently as it has one of the largest treasuries in the cryptocurrency scene. 

However, as I mentioned above, this isn‚Äôt the only thing that‚Äôll lead a DAO to glory, but the fact that it‚Äôs clearly set its plans to invest in promising spaces and create long term projects, gave it huge legitimacy. That even encouraged Bybit, which happens to be one of the largest exchanges and DeFi protocols in the market, as it contributes in almost $134 million in its treasury. 

Also the fact that this contribution happens to be in different tokens (ETH, USDT, USDC), gives the treasury a flexibility to adapt to different market scenarios. And this is what I was talking about. One should be looking for projects that tick numerous boxes in order to guarantee positive returns on their money, especially when it comes to investing in trends like DAOs. Even though I believe this year is going to be revolutionary for DAOs, but few are the ones that‚Äôll be able to survive for a long time.",1,9,False,,0.0

I'm really wanting to move to a dollar cost average (DCA) strategy instead of attempting to constantly time the market. 

So far I've mainly only invested in ADA during the dips (which have been frequent recently...). However, I'd like to move to other coins. One way I thought of is investing a fixed amount each month and split it between the top 5 coins by market cap. What are some common DCA strategies or maybe ones that have worked well for you?",0,33,False," Well I usually look at the market in general. If I see that the market is down, I then proceed and invest a bigger sum of money. And when I see that the market is rather high I invest less.

If you set a monthly/weekly budget for you to invest, then it would help a lot deciding where you go bigger and where smaller. I have a bot that auto buys every 3 days. This is DCA ‚Ä¶ only buying dips means your not buying at all on the upswing and missing out on gains. BTW I don‚Äôt sell. HODL. For a while I had $50 in almost every coin that Coinbase supported. Check it a couple times a day and when a coin has equity you sell off the equity (BTC goes up to $54 so I sell $4) and I didn't actually sell, I converted to Dai(I found stable coins ate less of your money on the spread) then if a coin dipped, say down to $45, I'd move the money from Dai. Just trying to keep everything in equilibrium. It's not dca, but it seemed to work really well. I only had about $800 but it grew to about 1200 before I had to sell for some.family trips and events that weren't really under my control. Hopefully when the biotech rally hits in the middle of this month I'll have some liquid funds I can put back into crypto. A technique you can combine in synergy with DCA is holding your coins in interest bearing accounts. This way you‚Äôre constantly lowering you average purchase price by ‚Äúpurchasing‚Äù coins for $0.00. 

If you‚Äôre curious about the rates you can earn, feel free to reference this [Interest Rates Comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/edit) I put together that details rates paid on almost 150 different coins. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. DCA is the best strategy if you stick to it completely, but still I would advise and hedge the risk with options from Siren Protocol

You should always try to minimize your risks, because unexpected things happen in life I DCA 55 dollars every week. 20-20 to BTC and ETH, 15 to various alts I like. I also have a second job, the money from there goes straight into crypto just like any extra money I happen to get.",0.9871

9,Is it time to buy the dip?,https://www.newbiescrypto.com/p/time-buy-dip,,16,29,False," If you believe in something to invest in then the most reliable approach is dollar cost averaging. Otherwise, it‚Äôs really more of a gamble considering all the data points to more errors in prediction amongst analysts and financial gurus than successes. We may never have the right time to buy the dip because we all see things differently. However, before buying the dip, the project use case should be considered because not all projects have a good use case in the ecosystem. Railgun, for example, has been consistently innovative despite the market situation and still maintains a price range that makes it significant due to its strong fundamentals. If there are no hiccups in the way, ZEC might start a bullish run, and it wouldn't hurt to look at projects with strong fundamentals before buying. I'm going to sound like a broken record here but this has to get across to people. Stop buying meme dog coins right now and buy bluechips like Celo and ICP. Projects like these have never been seen at these prices. It's literally a once in a lifetime opportunity. Nope It's the beat time to invest in upcoming and new projects.

My money is on KOL ,the token of an upcoming project called KOLnet that monetizes influencers through whitelists and token swaps for their social media marketing services. Bear markets are made to DCA!   


Smaller, regular investments will get you better average entry points than throwing all your money at this market thats swinging like a tether ball on a rope in zero gravity.   
...tether reference intentional... Buying the dip means different thing to different people. DCAing is still the best strategy to make the best out of bear markets like this. Interestingly, some altcoins seem to be doing quite well in terms of price actions. A good example is Railgun which has maintained a consistent price over the month. I believe it has something to do with innovations it just introduced to privacy in decentralized finance. MKR is another one that has stood out in the market. I believe it is more reasonable to spend on dips when a good resistance has been exhibited to an extent, especially for low and mid caps. Access to good information is what we investors needs to progress financially and generally in life. DCA I think at these levels is an ideal strategy

We all know shorts move much faster than longs (""the red waterfall""). But recently I realized that even my otherwise quite successful longs algo, when applied to shorts, give significantly poorer results. And it's not about the period of time when it is applied. Even in periods of huge crashes, it can not enter on time and misses the drop.

&#x200B;

So I was wondering if any of you uses different approach/algo/system for shorts than for longs? Usually every strategy is defined for shorts and longs just the opposite way. But I am not sure anymore this is the best advice.

Bitcoin is almost always either just repeating a pattern it has recently made, mirroring a pattern its made, or flipping the pattern its recently made. That sounds like a lot of possibilities but when you start getting into the weeds you can see where it can occasionally help.

Obviously, I cannot tell the future, but I am using a real-time example here for demonstration. This analysis will be 2 parts; the first part showing a pattern bitcoin made recently on 3hr timeframe. And the second part showing a potential repeating pattern happening on 1 hr timeframe.

[BTC 3hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qi0vYAuK/) the main thing to look at here is the section with 3 green triangles. Bitcoin is constantly printing these, it leads to a ton of head and shoulder type of patterns, but they arent always perfectly horizontal (for example the one I am showing is slanted on an angle).

Now if we zoom in to the [BTC 1hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pbiIYRbf/) we can find an almost identical formation. These aren't perfectly shaped which can make them more difficult to spot. But there is a chance that we get a repeating pattern and bitcoin is about to have a nice little run again.

You guys always criticize that I never provide any ""predictions"" on my posts and the answer is because predictions are dumb and impossible.

**TLDR**: Strategies are presented here to create basic positions from which you can explore other new strategies. As mentioned, options strategies allow the creation of positions with the risk aversion level from the investor's demands. Using the strategy as a hedge, it is necessary to consider whether your position is suitable or not.

**Get smarter:** Not any asset has options based on it. However, we can design our own to make contracts that closely resembles an asset we hold with another asset. Of course, the complexity and number of transactions also increase, they reduce profit by cost.

# General Conclusion

One of the most attractive feature of options is that it can be a combination of options or combined with other derivatives to create a variety of strategies. The possibilities for profit can be so varied that almost any investor can find a strategy that meets their preferred level of risk and is in line with the market forecast.

Without options, the strategies are very limited. If the assets are expected to increase, people would buy the stocks; if they are expected to decrease, people would sell them. Choice makes the move from forecasting to a profitable action plan, if the forecast is correct. Of course, the strategy will punish you for incorrect prediction. However, with the correct use of options, the punishment will be quite small and predictable.

In this newsletter, we will introduce some simple option strategies that you can apply easily. These strategies are the easiest to understand and require the least transaction.

# Covered Call Option strategy

>**TLDR:** I have $ETH. I sell options for $ETH so people can buy $ETH when prices increase. I get money upfront. I lose the infinite upside.

## Who will use this strategy?

### Own Asset

You have people who own the asset, say $ETH. In crypto space, we have two types of people. The first type is people who just have $ETH as an investment and keep it in their wallets. I'm looking at you, institutional investors.

The second type is people who are liquidity providers to protocols like HEGIC, OPYN.

### Sell Call Option

For people who are liquidity providers, this is where you will be selling a call option.

Crash course: call option is basically the ability for someone else to buy your ETH. You're selling the possibility for someone to buy this asset (ETH) from you at a different price.

### Example

Let's say ETH right now is worth $1800 and you want to sell this call option. The strike price is $1950 and they have to pay a premium of $100. Let's say ETH becomes $2200.

Because someone bought the call option from you, they can go to you and buy at $1950 because you've already made a promise. The benefit for you is that you received this $100 premium no matter what. This premium is why people want to be option sellers as they get to earn some money.

### How does this strategy help to manage risk?

This is money upfront whether ETH goes to $2200 or ETH drops to $1000. Whatever happens to ETH doesn't matter because I have this $100 upfront.",1,14,False,,0.0

&#x200B;

I intend to invest into BTC via monthly payments at the right moment. I will judge when to enter and exit the market using the Aurox terminal weekly indicators (which claim to have a high accuracy rate). I'll move into stablecoins during downward trending periods shown by red indicators. Chart showing the history of the weekly indicators via Aurox here, looks legit:

&#x200B;

In conjunction to this, I'll hold my coins in Amber App, which says it gives strong APRs for BTC if held there for a while. They make money via arbitrage. I'm thinking of doing this rather than opt for a lending solution like KuCoin - as it never seems to work for me, loans get returned too soon.

So, yeah - rip it apart! Ideas and comments welcome",1,43,False," You're failing to understand that pro traders know that countless newbies such as yourself are going to do this and counter trade. 

Just pick a day of the week and DCA.  Regardless of price.  You wont catch the bottom but you wont pay the top either.  Manage being an average investor first before attempting to beat everyone in the market You shouldn‚Äôt try to time the market. Chances are you will lose. I will advice traders especially newbies to have orientation of trading before they get involved in it because the crypto market has been unstable, forget predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses. No $ORAI? Don‚Äôt you know the potential of AI? [removed] The problem is blindingly following the indicator. The Aurox team themselves even say the indicator is NOT to be used as a buy/sell signal.  If your are trying to buy/sell strictly based on the indicator, you WILL lose.   It's a great piece of the puzzle, but don't follow it without looking at the rest of whats going on..

For the record, I'm not trying to bash the URUS. I've been in AUROX for quite a while... Its great.  I rode the Aurox URUS token with a good bag to a 1800% increase this year, culminating last week w/ Georgi at the conference.  The team is doing great things, just don't trade blindly with their tools.

9,"Made $10K this week, At What point do you take Profits? What strategies so you use for profit taking?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/oa8x6c/made_10k_this_week_at_what_point_do_you_take/,"Over the past 5 years, I always struggled with taking profits. Often, I end up riding things up then down then back up then down. Idk if its Greed or Fear of Missing out on Potential Profits. What strategies do you guys use to take profits? Anyone here takes a small percentage weekly or monthly? When you sell stuff, do you keep a small percentage like 10-15% just in case the coin pumps later? A lot of times I sell something that hasn‚Äôt been moving for months and then it conveniently pumps after I sell it as if they were all waiting for me to leave haha. 

I watched my portfolio go from $200 in Early December 2020 to around $43,000 during the first week of May 2021 (Thanks to all the Meme Tokens). Then it dropped a lot, but now its recovering. I still have PTSD from the January 2018 crash, but what I learned from that is that HODLing through that crash would have made me back everything that I had if I had faith and patience. I watched the same thing happen again last month. My guts and instincts were telling me to Buy stuff when they‚Äôre red even when they‚Äôre dipping daily. It was hard tbh. 

I remember everyone wishing for low prices and saying ‚ÄúIf xxx goes back to $$$, i‚Äôm buying a lot‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf I bought xxx last month or last year at those prices, I would have been rich‚Äù. Everyone says things like that and how if they bought Bitcoin or any other coin, they would be millionaires, but the reality is that if they bought any coin early, they‚Äôd sell it early or panic sell it at a Loss after any of the annual/yearly FUDs that come and go. 

I don‚Äôt trade on emotions and I am unfazed/desensitized to FUD. I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs part of the issue since I suck at taking profits. Yes, I know that historically things tend to go up if you zoom out, but I lost around a million dollar‚Äôs worth of profits between this bull run and the last one mainly because of my HODLer mentality. I tried switching back and forth between being a Trader and Holder, but I just couldn‚Äôt convince myself to do it. How do you guys do it? Any tips or suggestions or advice? And for profits, what kinda strategies do you guys use for taking them? (A percentage of the profits? Taking only your initial investment?). Don‚Äôt tell me that we Never Take Profits here. 

Holding is easy, Taking Profits is Hard. Looking for Genuine advice.",239,141,False," When you 5 X in a token/coin, pull your original investment out, which will be 20%.

Then start the 30/15 DCA out method.

It goes up another 30%, take out 15%.

It goes up another 30%, take out another 15%.

Rinse and repeat. Only sell 50% ever. Hodl the rest. Worked for me since 2011. Thank Christ I only sold 1/2 my eth ico at $10 ü§£üòÖ Ill hodl for my retirement. Take profits when you are ready.  Don't matter what anyone thinks.  If you want to take profits, do it. Set a goal, and acknowledge to yourself that none of your coins are too sacred to trade. The fear of having FOMO when you take profits and see it pop way up again is super real, but you can't think like that My father-in-law always says if you double your money take half out and don't worry about the rest,  you basically have free money to play with that you never had so don't worry what happens after that.  We did just that in 2018 and I'm planning on doing that this time also. Might just have to hold a little longer because I showed up a little late this run but it will happen. >but what I learned from that is that HODLing through that crash would have made me back everything that I had if I had faith and patience.

What this means is that you are far better off just steadily investing and growing your stack than trading and trying to beat the game. Pick solid platforms with good tech and promising adoption. Buy consistently and just hodl. This is the strategy that just about every successful crypto investor has followed. Before investing always set a profit benchmark for yourself. When you hit don't be greedy, take your profits and move on. I got in on PNODE at IDO level took my profit when it did 10x after the launch. Now I bought some more and added to my bag because I have so much believe in the team. Hopeful I make a 20x from it soon. You can always sell 3%. How about taking cash out to diversify? 

Put some into property to rent out, consider a pension .. both of these are bets against the whole crypto thing crashing and leaving you with nothing. 

Then look for quality alts that are launching or have recently launched (not shit coins for gods sake) and leave them for a few years to see if one turns into 100x or 1000x

Then continue to speculate / day trade. What is your goal? Optimizing fiat or crypto? It's actually a pretty tricky question. I used to trade infrequently, but I would almost always ""win."" If I thought a coin was low, I'd buy and hodl until it went up. If you do that long enough, you'll win most of your trades. The problem is that I traded away a good bit of bitcoin. Buy at $5k, sell at $6. Wait a bit until the market makes sense and buy at $11k and sell at $11.8k. My buy position kept dropping as the value rose. 

I was trading without a plan. I simultaneously made fiat and lost crypto. Now my fiat gains don't cover the crypto I lost. I now have long term hodl positions that I don't trade, and I don't enter a trade unless I have an exit point identified. Hit that exit point and sell without regret. It may go up more, but there are many, many, many other coins out there that can be traded. 

I keep a rough running tally of my tax hit, and set aside 40% of my winning trades for taxes. If I lose a few trades and my tax money is more than the anticipated bill, I DCA that into my hodl BTC and ETH positions. I've been thinking about this a lot also. You have to accept that you'll never sell at the peak. Or almost never. We all know its easy to say ohhh why didn't I take some profits, look at that huge jump, but we forget how we felt at the time, ohhhh what if it goes up another 5x, 10x etc. I'll miss out on all that. 

Ive come to the conclusion that for me I think the best option will be to pick a fiat amount ID be happy selling at. Let's say I know that I could FIRE if I made ¬£500k, then I'll set that ad my figure and no matter what if my holdings hit that number I'll get out.

Also you could choose a figure early and put in some sell orders so that it takes the decision making out of it. Plus it means if there is a huge jump one day and you were busy then your order would hopefully still go through. What has worked for me in the past (and what I failed to do multiple times), is that whenever I think ‚Äúhm, this may be a good idea to take some profits‚Äù, it usually is. 200 to 43k that's amazing! So your original investment was $200? And in 5 months, without investing anymore money, you‚Äôve made $43,000? 

How‚Äôs that possible? Hey OP, if you haven't formulated a plan, I'd recommend you Google trailing stop losses.  Best of luck
  
Edit: use multiple Hey man, I really liked your post, and felt quite the same way. 

Bought a couple ETH back in 2018, and I was like, I hope I'll make a few bucks in a couple of years. I wasn't quite measuring what I was getting into, even though I knew it felt more than right to put some money in.

2 and half years later, I saw my money go up and down on a screen, but I still have a fuck load more than what I put. I strongly believe in ETH, read and understood a lot about it, and I can't really think about selling, even though this cash would help me a lot. Not a very rational decision, but I sort of feel safer still having it, instead of having some euros to spend. I still use it to buy online, a good way to enjoy my profits ü§∑

You don't have to sell if you don't feel like you need it I guess I think if you can grab 20% profits you are good.  I see two strategies.  1).  Get out all together, or 2) sell your original amount and keep the residual stock as ‚Äúfree‚Äù shares I wouldn't ever sell your crypto. To put it in fait and watch it lose value....  That's the whole point of Crypto, leaving the legacy financial system. How many people who got on the life raft getting off the Titanic said  ""How long should we wait before we get back on the boat?"" NONE! This post is sooo me in the same boat! Even reading your comments without looking at who wrote them I kept thinking to myself, ‚Äòyup, that‚Äôs me‚Äô

You‚Äôre definitely not alone and there‚Äôs definitely a learning curve To figuring out a system that works for you and then working that system. 

The comments here have some great ideas though! Never. You just hodl Buddy of mine and I came up with our own calculation for it. Pretty sick.https://i.imgur.com/OYu1TS2.jpg I would have taken some off the table between $200 and $43k, just me though Just a lurker here.  

How do you know about the meme tokens.  What subs to follow. When your coin doubles take out 50% (your original investment). Then the remaining coins are pure profit. Then when that doubles again you can take out 50%. Repeat until you've sold it all.

This is a strategy I've come across. Seems pretty solid. It's none emotional trading, if you stick to the rules. 

Also you're always prepared to buy the dip as you have your original investment back and also profits to reinvest. I like to take profits in three ways: 1. I sell down a portion of my position on an upward trend. 2. I sell half of my position on an upward trend. 3. I sell the rest of my position on an upward trend. After my investment doubles, I take half of the total profit. $1000 turns into $2000? I take $500. I sort of meet myself halfway of taking profits and maybe missing out on more pumps, but also have money on the side for dips. Anyone else have something that works for them pretty well? I'm like you, OP. I don't like converting to fiat. I need a reason or a written exit strategy, so I literally do that. I take a pen and write on an old-fashioned notebook the various exits for each of my token and coin. I do that as soon as I put money in a project. [removed] Always take some profits. If I‚Äôd made $10k I‚Äôd take 2k out into Fiat for example. Just cream some off. I know everyone is like HODL but I‚Äôm too poor to watch thousands of dollars evaporate. I‚Äôll probably never be a crypto millionaire but at over the years you‚Äôll make some decent cash. I don't even pretend to understand crypto. I buy a little now and then, Doge for the lulz and LTC because it's cheap. If it doubles, I sell half and put that money into my Roth IRA. I took profits when I wanted to purchase a puppy for my girlfriend, I sold half of my holdings in April and held the rest. Just take profits when you need them or want to treat yourself to something you usually wouldn‚Äôt buy, that way you see the benefits of your investments in real life. Never, buy something You take profits as you see fit 
It‚Äôs a personal thing My dream is to never convert my cryptos back into fiat. Obviously I would if I need the cash for basic necessities but capital gains are a bummer. I hope someday to be able to buy my groceries with crypto. Keep holding. Just hold. When it seems like it's way too high then sell.

Just. Hold. Imagine if you said the same thing 5 years ago. Had you held til today the difference would be astronomical. 

Just hold. I have the same problem and lost out on a million in 2018 Hold for at least a year if you're in the US. Happens with me as well. I usually see myself riding the dip with the hopes that I'll see a few green candles. These day's I've been taking out my initial investment and letting the rest run its course. Sounds like you need some new goals to bring back the excitement. If you truly don‚Äôt have any personal desires, let your crypto buy you happiness. Build it up and take profits for charity. See how many people you can help, how many lives you can have a positive impact on. Warren Buffet said something to the effect that he measures success by the number of people that you want to love you, actually do. Good luck. I use a strategy with two underlying assumptions:
1) In the long term most major coins will go up.
2) It will be a bumpy road to get there.

I invest, let's say, $1,000 in a coin at $1.00. I set two buy orders:
1) Buy 25% more of the holding at $800 (20% drop)
2) Sell 20% of the holding at $1,250 (25% gain)

Each time an order is triggered, I reset the orders for a 20% drop/25% gain. If a coin goes down 20%, then returns to its original price, I take an overall profit of $50 (5% of the original investment) and still have the same position as I originally started with. It also ensures I always have almost the exact same amount of fiat invested - if I invest $10,000 across 10 coins, I will still have about $10,000 invested no matter how much the coins go up or down.

It's a very conservative system not designed to maximize profit as much as to limit risk and ensure I'm always taking some profit during the good times. But it works for me as someone willing to give up some of the upside potential in exchange for slow, steady gains and something to prevent me from trading emotionally. I used to look for crazy rockets before to make good gains. Then I got rekt, I lost more than 80% of my investments.

  
Since that day, I am only after steady sustainable growth and safety became my priority. And that led me to NDAU, the adaptive currency. I feel so much better HODLing secure cryptos and getting staking rewards, far away from risks and volatility! Have an exit strategy and price target before getting into any coin. Sell small portions at every price target and never sell 100% of it all, always leave a small amount to ride any unexpected gains. DCA in then do the opposite on the way out. - Michelle Whitedove u/Alpha-Charlie-Romeo",0.9999
9,Taking advantage of a bear market smartly does not require gathering additional crypto. You'll also need to enhance your knowledge.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/ur7ncu/taking_advantage_of_a_bear_market_smartly_does/,"You may call the price movements over the preceding six months anything you choose. Even if we've improved slightly in the last two months, we're still on the decrease. But, in the case of a drop, I believe we all know what to do. Yes, make the purchase. You should try to time your fall such that you are at the bottom and can restock your supplies. Even if we fall lower, everyone who does that is smart, since no one will notice if you bought at 40k or 47k in ten years.  


However, acquiring knowledge is another thing to do to completely gain from a terrible market. Because there aren't as many hopium-traders during a bad market as there are during a bull market, you can learn the most about the market. Learn how people react to a little pump during certain periods, for example, and how it goes. Instead, do some study to learn about new concepts. Cardano, ROSE, and now High Sloth Society¬†were all found this way. Keep an eye on the situation.

It‚Äôs not about timing the bottom. That‚Äôs straight up gambling! Trying to time the bottom will get you REKT. What you should be doing is learning basic TA so you have a rough idea where a correction is likely to end up. You then place a number of buy orders around different support levels. Some will take and some won‚Äôt. This is not timing the bottom! If you don‚Äôt know how to do TA and can‚Äôt be bothered to learn, then you simply average down if you are liquid enough. You are mixing trading and investing together. They are not the same and they require different strategies. Mixing these and not defining what each is will get you REKT.

People actually have different strategy they use.

While the general PA is boring, people can learn new things, explore the space, see what product is truly working as intended & what projects are solving fundamental problems in the space; like scaling, liquidity, hack/exploit, etc This is accurate. I hate to see my bags underwater but thanks to this market, I have had the time and chance to explore and learn about new concepts and projects. I discovered FLUID, which is an AI quant-based liquidity aggregator that's looking to bring connected liquidity to the industry and the StarkNet Ecosystem, an L2 which I am still exploring.

Asides that, I'm mostly staking and biding my time to buy dips as well as invest in new projects. Actually, it is proven that there are strategies that can be put in place to make the best out of the bear market. Trying to enhance knowledge is tricky considering how far the space has gone. Right now, I can't think of a better way to get through the bear market by using automated yield aggregators. Does two things: spreads out the risk and doesn't require much knowledge to make decent yield out of it. A good example are the available spools on spoolfi with varying risk scores ranging from 16-19% based on the risk tolerance.",0.9486
9,Sell it all?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/uj4ahk/sell_it_all/,"US Tax Question/Strategy during a down market.

Would it be crazy to consider selling all my crypto while I am deep down, harvest the loss for this tax year and rebalance by buying back a very similar but different portfolio?

I know wash sales were a thing last tax year, and I did hear some talk about it going away this coming tax year, but I don't believe that has been put into motion and you can still wash with no waiting period.

I guess I am trying to think of cons other than fees and time. It seems like there is for sure a plus tax break on income up to 3k - assuming markets don't bounce back and I don't have more capital gains to write off by year-end, plus an opportunity to consolidate to core projects.

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated :)

&#x200B;

example of a wash sale and leveraging a loss against capital gains and income for clarity:

I bought 1 BTC for 64k at the ATH, and now I want to sell that 1 BTC at 35K for a loss of 29k, but then take that money and immediately buy back the 1 BTC for 35K for a net loss of 0 BTC, but a capital loss of $29k against this tax season.

That 29K loss can then be deducted for any capital gains to reduce overall tax liability, but if all capital gains are balanced to 0 then you can take a max of 3k against normal income before rolling the capital loss into the next tax season.

&#x200B;

Edit:

Seems like there is a lot of confusion around what I am asking. I am not planning on selling my portfolio and walking away with the loss. No need to respond ""just hodl"" or DCA those are givens. This question is specific to the pros and cons of a wash sale for tax purposes.

Some tidbits I found through his exploration:

""As of December 2021, there is no crypto wash sale rule in place‚Äìyet. The IRS officially considers digital currency to be property rather than a security.""

""Yes, it‚Äôs possible that cryptocurrency could eventually become subject to wash sale rules.""

""Meanwhile, the Build Back Better Act includes a proposal to subject cryptocurrencies to the wash sale rule. If the Act were to become law, cryptocurrencies would be subject to the same treatment as stocks, mutual funds and other securities when applying the wash sale rule. That means cryptocurrency investors could face new tax liabilities when selling crypto at a loss and buying new crypto assets.""

",35,159,False," Buy low, sell high. Is it really that hard? ""any thoughts you have are greatly appreciated""

That was your mistake! These thoughts you are getting are mostly terrible lol

I don't think there is any downside other than what you already mentioned ie fees and time. 

Do a thought exercise, pretend you had sold it all. What would you buy back? How would you reorganize your portfolio ideally? Then just rebalance to hit those %.  That will minimize your fees.  

Personally I've found that once I've sold things (with the intention to buy it back) that I realized I didn't actually want it enough to buy it back, so I didn't and reinvested elsewhere. This game is all psychological. I would also like to know. Average down if you have faith in the project. If not, sell. Crypto wash sales were very helpful for me end of last year.  Saved me fair amount of money in federal taxes‚Ä¶.mostly altcoins that dropped but were projects i still like. if you sell, wash trade, and buy in at the same price it will give you a cap loss in the short term, but if the price goes back up and you sell you will be net neutral (because of cap gains), except you lost time and fees. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but I don‚Äôt believe the wash sale applies to crypto. Technically it‚Äôs not a security. In the UK you have to stay out of that asset for 30 days after selling. I think it's the same in the US.

Up to you if it's worth the risk of a major price move while you're out of the trade. With the state of crypto atm you could probably buy some staked BTC of some kind and call it a different token to get around the law that way. if the ratios are good and you're looking to rebalance coins then it is smart to do it while prices are down to minimize tax costs. or if you have substantial other tax costs that if you sold you could offset and then buy back in more.   


these are the only real reasons (other than no confidence in crypto in which case have fun with fiat in 20-30 years) I don't believe selling is a good idea. Infact, I consider it a totally bad idea. Holding is not a very good one either. I think yield farming is the best option, especially with stablecoins to eliminate the issue of volatility. However, it requires diligence to get protocols that offer good rates. Personally, my stables deposits are in the genesis spools at spoolfi and I am confident of the returns I will be getting. Since it's an automated protocol, I don't have to do a lot of monitoring and rebalancing. For me, it beats the option of holding or selling If you are very much concerned about taxes, then I'll recommend that you start thinking about privacy protocols, especially the ones that are scalable with DeFi protocols like Railgun. I believe if you work it out properly, You'll be able to navigate through the strict tax barriers Wow you are really getting some terrible responses to this question that are not addressing what you actually asked.

I‚Äôm contemplating doing the same thing you are suggesting, but taking losses on some cryptos and buying back with others. I wouldn‚Äôt count on there not being a wash sale rule next year, so wouldn‚Äôt recommend selling your BTC just to buy more BTC.  

You should probably calculate how much expected capital gains you will have this year and offset with crypto realized losses, but wouldn‚Äôt sell too much to go much past the $3k tax loss carryover limit. 

Personally, I am likely to also experience losses in stocks this year so there won‚Äôt be much capital gains to offset by realizing a tax loss, so likely will just hold. It depends what you are holding. If they are crypto tokens erc-20 , bep-20 etc then it‚Äôs risky to hodl.
If you are hodling bitcoin, Eth , Ada etc then it‚Äôs highly likely that they hit ATH in the future. Wash sales rules do not apply to crypto. It's crazy to sell ALL your crypto at this point in time, imo.

I'm holding and staking. This is why I like to go for projects that offer good staking rewards like ATOM, OIN, ROWAN, OSMO, JUNO, NEAR, SCRT.

They only thing that I'd say is alright to sell now are those shitcoins one might have dabbled in and the profits would go into stablecoin staking until the new gems on my radar like FLD and TEAM are up for sale.

Buy high and sell low is the fastest way to rekt city and NOT making it..but you know that already. Simple solution, don't tell the tax office shit. DCA I sold everything at the end of Feb. might buy back in someday but I believe we are nowhere near the bottom yet. Is it the same rule as stock, where you can only claim $3,000 of losses on taxes? Will you think of doing this every time there is a downturn? Keep it and buy another BTC then you will have 2 and no taxable events :) Washtrading is illegal. But besides of that, i would harvest losses now.

Actually I did. Bad idea Don't sell, hold. But if you don't want your crypto anymore just help a bro, and send it to me. I'll be glad to recive that. We're halfway to the next BTC halving. Hold until then if you can. 

I'm US based too. Totally fine with holding long term for the more favorable long term capital gains tax when profits come. Until then, accumulate! Wouldn't you have to eventually pay taxes for your gains when Bitcoin pumps again and you sell? You may want to pay this question in r/CryptoTax

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTax?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share Just hold it mate. Or transfer it to ETH and stake it. It will recover eventually. [removed] Did you expect it not to drop at all?

I mean we've always known that crypto is up and down so it's normal to plan for DCA.

Also with staking, it cushions the blows. Staking rewards from atom, scrt, dafi, rowan, green, osmo, juno is what keeps me going on days like this.

Plus like they say, ""when in doubt zoom out""! Nooo  


It's the best time to buy coins since the most of them on the dip.  
Anyone who related to crypto knows this easy rule: ""Buy low and sell high""

&#x200B;

>**CeFi** \- Hodlnaut ( \~%8 APY for BTC and ETH, \~12% on USDC)

All of my interest is paid in BTC for now. But the time will come when the market sags; it's a part of it. 

At that time, I'll want fiat money for new opportunities to focus the velocity on cash payments. 

So check this out: You can park USDC, ETH, and BTC on Hodlnaut. And, you can get your interest paid in any of the currencies they deal with and, you can direct each of your holdings to pay interest in the currency of your choice.

So, I'm growing BTC at a FAST clip by directing my USDC to pay in BTC and my ETH to pay in BTC. And when I hit my goal on BTC, I'll direct all interest to be paid in ETH.

Here's the fun part, when I direct everything to pay in USDC, which itself grows at 12.5% APY, I'm friggin' growing money.

*Here's a real-life example:* 

My 2 BTC and 20 ETH and 3000 USCD are growing my BTC at just over 1% a month. So that's about 2000 USD per month.

>**DeFi** \- Aave/ Compound (\~1% for wBTC and ETH, \~7% for USDC)

Take out a loan for a stable coin (USDC) using my wBTC, ETH as collateral 

Watch as wBTC; ETH goes up while I still have money in my pocket to pay my bills or lend it again for \~7%

The only thing that can go wrong is you going over 50% for borrowing, and we get a hero-level crash. Other than that, it's the smart thing to do for any coin you'll hold in the long term if you think it'll go up more than 10% in a year (borrow APR for stable coins).

You can also get interest on the percentage of your collateral that you don't use to take out a loan.

My concern would be your transaction costs more so than the taxes 
Those taxes would need to be paid Just use crypto tax software...it will do it all for you automatically. It depends where you live (everywhere has different regulations) ... I've been bouncing the idea around of opening a collateralized debt position with MakerDAO.  Essentially if you wanted to cash out 5,000 you could open up a CDP with say: 15,000 worth of collateral. Then you mint 5,000 DAI, sell it for fiat and now you have $5000ish.  If the price goes up you can rebuy it at that price, if it goes down and is below the over collateralization ratio it would get liquidated and you would have to pay a fee (13% I think).

I'm in a similar boat as you, held through the 2017/2018 crash, the only reason I am considering this is because since I found smart contracts in 2017 I've been a big fan of the technology and I still am!

9,What you need to keep a level head in this bull run! My strategy and suggestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/qbobci/what_you_need_to_keep_a_level_head_in_this_bull/,"[Link to previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/qa0941/bitcoin_etfs_fomo_things_im_watching_as_we_go/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Starting off with some really basic stuff on the [Total Crypto Market Cap](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zSMqYUxm/). Just wanted to point out a very basic bullish idea. The all time high of the crypto market has been broken and in the last day the all time high has been retested absolutely perfectly. This is a wonderful sign for the market in the near future. Its such simple basic ideas like this Support/Resistance flip with a valid retest that will make so much more money in crypto than the fancy, overcomplex analysis. It's also very possible that we will retest this level a couple more times soon but the important thing to know is that it will provide good support. If you haven't read between the lines yet, I'll make it obvious: If we get a pullback and the Total market cap pulls back to that support, its a perfect time to consider opening positions. But you need more than this one idea, I'll come back to this in a second.

And for the sake of teaching, it's always good to have confluence between multiple ideas. Here is my [USDT Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Z14x4MMu/) chart I shared a few days ago saying we had to keep an eye on this double bottom. The support level I have had drawn had a perfect breakout and retest, and this matched our ideas with the Total chart above. Again, confirms the bullish sentiment in the market.

[Bitcoin Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/akSRW2cC/) is quickly approaching the neckline of the double bottom. Keep in mine, where I put the neckline may not be exact, but there is definitely a resistance zone in that area.  
And a [Bitcoin 2hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Jea6hA2A/) chart to compliment the BTC.D chart. A couple days ago I mentioned an upward break of a rising channel is mega bullish. Turns out that was the case, and it even gave us an iconic retest. That formed another rising channel earlier today and that even broke higher and now we are headed to ATH. I'm mostly showing this to display where resistance levels may be for those traders that are looking for small dips to buy in. I extended the rising channels because those will provide support in the event of pullbacks. And all of the dashed purple lines in the background will provide support as well. I even left my alert line on the chart because I'm a nice guy :)

And now we have to tie it all together. I mentioned I would come back to an idea I mentioned in the first paragraph. Find confluence between multiple ideas! Don't buy just because the TOTAL chart cane back to support, that doesnt mean your particular coin of interest is done dropping (maybe yours didnt even pullback!) Find support levels on the coin you want to buy, wait for the pullbacks to line up between the TOTAL (TOTAL2 and TOTAL3 are good too depending on the coin of interest). Look at the BTC.D chart and find its resistance and support. Buy in on confluence and you will not lose!

&#x200B;

Questions welcome. Happy trading!",6,6,True," These are some really cool suggestions and thoughts.Thank you very much!But i knew many of those because of u/moonstake . It's the largest stake pool network in Asia and i get all this information from this platform,looking and analysing the potential of coins/tokens.Apparently,there are more than 2000 cryptos that can be analysed. So if you know what crypto is doing what in terms of price, you become a level-headed person because you will make the decisions based on your research. cheers! >wait for the pullbacks to line up between the TOTAL (TOTAL2 and TOTAL3

9,BTC ideas going into the weekend,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/uzwmqt/btc_ideas_going_into_the_weekend/,"*This is tailored toward traders and only traders, it will not apply to anyone that has a hodl-based strategy.*

Some basic BTC ideas going into the weekend. 

* The descending triangle should break lower
* The rising wedge should break lower
* The descending triangle lower support was regained but with low volume
* If the descending triangle support is lost again, watch for a retest and then a most to the range lows (could be lower than the $27k level I have marked)

Once of my favorite strategies recently has been trading the bull and bear traps. It's one of the highest success rate trading methods I use, it just doesn't happen very frequently being that it is always against the probability. But this idea is shown on the chart with the blue area. On a retest of range higher is where I will be loading with longs, until then just short term trading.

9,Using trading bots on binance,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/s0jig1/using_trading_bots_on_binance/,"I don‚Äôt do a lot of trading, but when I do, I really suck at it. This is why I don‚Äôt really place a lot of money on it since I know I might end up losing a lot. But with the little amount I use to trade, I thought I could find something that might help me.

I thought of using trading bots, and came across several like [Tradesanta](https://tradesanta.com/en), [3commas](https://3commas.io/), [Stoic](https://stoic.ai/?r=1), and [Cryptohopper](https://www.cryptohopper.com/).  I‚Äôm looking through reddit for some reviews for each app, but I want to know what you guys think.

I have never used trading bots before, so I just wanted to know if anyone out there heard of it or has experience using any of these. I want to know your experience on using it or any other similar trading bots.",163,196,False," If you're a bit more tech-savvy, I can highly recommend FreqTrade, which is a self-hosted open source bot that let's you write strategies via Python.

It already comes with a lot of strats and you can download a lot more from various github repos or their discord. But the cool thing about it is that you can implement your own strategy, since the entire framework is already being provided by freqtrade (exchange support, notifications, web interface, indicators, backtesting, etc.) Bots don‚Äôt guarantee success. It is important to be cautious. Using bitsgap to grid trade on spot market , you will get around 1-2% daily (average) if you manage to proper range and diversify. You also need some maket knowledge to start at good time to maximize profit. I use 3commas and like it with the trading view panel and such. I had a REAL hard time with cryptohopper and don‚Äôt recommend it as your first. From what I checked in their telegram channel Stoic is going to allow more hedge changes in the platform. Though this feature can be unlocked if you have their Stoic token. I made my own trading bot and have had success with that. I would recommend to make your own bot rather than getting bots from other people. Because if those bots was actually any good, the creator wouldn't be sharing them. Are trading bots generally safe? In terms of usage I mean. Not for instance, gaining or losing on a trade. I am using STOIC. I couldn‚Äôt possibly research and follow all the coins that there are to trade. I like it and will continue to use it. The trades have been good and it takes out a lot of the emotion.  I also still have other accounts too. Bots are a bane on the crypto space and should burn in the fires of hell. You can use TradingView scripts on Bonfida on Solana as well. I have seen people getting rekt because they're relying too much on trading bots. Even seasoned traders take up to 8 years learning how to trade with almost $100,000 loss every year before they started to profit. Sure it's hard, but think of it as your enrollment fee before you actually profit for yourself. Try paper trading instead, then start day trading on your own. [deleted] Cryptohopper is great for basic bots using indicators. But right now I‚Äôm using Coygo for arbitrage bots [removed] Has anyone actually made any significant cash trading using bots?

Best Strategy in Crypto.

But when BTC and ETH are 75-85% down

Start Selling when its 5-10x up.

Rinse Repeat. No Bots needed. :) Dollar cost into projects you understand and believe in, and take a long term view that way you are not subject to the ebbs and flows of the crypto market and therefore not over-reacting to it.

Remember nobody who bought Bitcoin 5 years ago has lost money, but those that sold did. It is  very nice project under blockchain technology. I really like the concept of this project, good idea with strong team- We will support this project. I would love a bot but what about taxes with all this rapid succession of buying and selling? bots dont always do their job sometimes they missed a big opportunity. Best to code your own bot so you learn from it. I've code some in python using an api that hooks to over 100 exchanges and also learn different trading strategies and trends such as rsi7 and supertrend. Best bots use a combination of all strategies. Grid trading allows you to automate a crypto grid trading strategy on Binance. I have tested Tradesanta, 3Commas and Cryptohopper with real investments. You can find my detailed reports regarding each tool here:

* [Tradesanta reports](https://tradingbot.info/category/results/tradesanta/)
* [3Commas reports](https://tradingbot.info/category/results/3commas/)
* [Cryptohopper reports](https://tradingbot.info/category/results/cryptohopper/)

I honestly think that anyone that fell for this scam was either trying to make quick profits, or they‚Äôre genuinely gullible, I mean I can‚Äôt even imagine what this coin‚Äôs marketing strategy was to attract all those investors. 


We should try and point out obvious scams as much as possible, to help new comers not fall for hypes, and guide them to invest in more community focused projects, like DAO based projects. 


One example is BitDAO that‚Äôs community led, where BIT holders vote on which project to support next, aiming to build a tokenized economy that everyone can become a part of. 


And if they‚Äôre more NFT-oriented they can look into DAOs like PleasrDAO, that aims to collect digital art that represents and funds important ideas, movements and causes that have been memorialized on-chain as NFTs. 


Also, individually researching the team behind any new startup, has proven to be a great technique for me to draw the line between projects with actual utilities, and ones that only rely on hypes.",8,10,False," There are so many scams out there. Focus should be on which coins have actual utility, economics and tokenomics that make sense. I look for projects making actual revenue, so you could put an intrinsic value on the project.

I disagree, $5k~$10k is a good entry point. Everything is oversold right now. Even the US Dollar is going back up. To be honest, I can't even imagine how much usdt it will cost in a month go on, pump it! This motherf*cker. Has he been liquidated yet? MS needs you to buy in now so he doesnt get more margin calls. Michael J. Saylor is absolutely right. Many complained that they missed the Bitcoin opportunity when its price was $69K in November 2021.

Now they have another opportunity to climb aboard the revolutionary train that aims to return power over money to the people.

And what do these people do? They let fear rule them!

Instead of acting with logical reasoning, these people let their emotions guide their choices. These are the same people who will express regret in the future when the price of Bitcoin rises above $100K.

The opportunities are the same for everyone with Bitcoin. The difference is that some people take them, while others choose not to, preferring to have regrets later. No it‚Äôs not Fuck all the way off. ‚Äú if you don‚Äôt sell it can‚Äôt lose value‚Äù. Whistles past the graveyard. I decided that I am never going to invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum again.

There are other platforms for this, but I feel Spool is the best at the present because it involves the automatic channeling of funds among multiple yield aggregators, resulting in a risk-managed ecosystem for the stable coins deposited in its spools. It may not be the optimal strategy, but I believe that buying the dip now will provide a lot of people with good profits once the bullrun begins, especially if you focus on low market cap tokens. Due to discussions regarding regulations, the recent downturn in the crypto market has given traction to certain projects, such as RAIL, XMR, and SCRT, and has led me to see potential in them. I've been keeping an eye on these privacy protocols, though Railgun stands out because of its multichain features and delivery of complete privacy utility, but they're all privacy protocols with potential, so buying the dip is a good option as well. I think that smart investors are buying now, if you look at the statistics, the whales are now buying BTC LINK and other coins  
  
But NFT also bring money on bear market, Troll Town NFT collection was free, some NFT were sold at 5-20 ETH, AngelBlock mint price was 0.069 ETH , now some already sold at 2-4 ETH which is also very cool Cool article and great strategies, especially buying the dips and going for blue chips; ETH, OCEAN, CTSI, and DIA to name a few. If you have noticed, these projects are focused on building right now, I believe they will take off once we are past this bear market. I think I'm doing it right by buying the dip and going for blue chips like ETH, MATIC, OCEAN and FTM. Hoping to see them melt faces once the bear market is over. This is the best time to get in as NFTs are the hot topic currently and the demand is massive. Everyone is joining the party like legendary driver Ayrton Senna's f1 car NFT collection hosted by AXL INU. Its best to catch them early otherwise the price might rise to astronomical heights. Put simply, smart investors are buying the dip and staking cryptos like Celo and ICP during this downturn. You can't predict the market so just buy the dip and stake. That's what I do and I'm doing well. The smartest way is to keep things simple, in my opinion. Set it once and forget it in low risk spools while the auto compounder does the rest.

He told you to mortgage your home and buy BTC at 64k, of course he's going to say this is ideal after a -66% discount lol

Bitcoin will at the very least hit 17.3k

Most likely hit $12,420

10,Small Account Challenge - Week 2 Roundup - 130% Portfolio Gain - Strategy and Lessons learned so far!!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/ukgtrj/small_account_challenge_week_2_roundup_130/,"**NOTE: While i am aware that the challenge itself is stocks and not crypto, everything outlined in here, works for crypto these are genral trading trading rules.**

Hey all,

Welcome to the 9th day of the $1k to $10k Challenge, where I daytrade my way to $10k.

A few notes before the update:

1. I'm using a cash account to avoid PDT
2. I mostly day trade 0DTE QQQ options, but not opposed to any opportunity that comes up
3. I use Support/Resistances, VWAP, 50/200 MA, and RSI to daytrade.
4. I use the 1-minute chart

**Challenge Overview**

2 weeks in and we are up 130%, this is beyond amazing! No longer do i  have to do 1 contract per trade. I swear you dont know how much this  means, till you lose it.So normally i give a daily breakdown, but i  thought i would collect all the questions i have been asked on Reddit  and Discord and create a sort of FAQ that everyone could refer to, if  need be. Please note non of this is financial advice and im by no means  the best trader but i do well enough to live off trading. But before we  start here is the obligatory account update.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b3ow1sczx2y81.jpg?width=368&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3922bcec3c093d4235e6ec51d16ec6ed94aaea0b

**What is the Setup I Use?**

Let's  go over my trading setup since I have been asked about that . Now I  like to keep things super simple, I'm not a fan of a million screens and  indicators.

* I use TradingView for charting, on that, I have RSI, VWAP, 50/200 MA, and Volume Profile loaded up.
* I  use IKBR as my broker and use the mobile app so I can look at my screen  for the chart and my phone to order, I just got used to this setup but  you can TradeStation or a different broker, whatever you are really  comfortable with, it doesn't make much of a difference.
* While  they haven't come into play yet but I also use Unusual Whales for  Options Flow and IKBR or TD Ameritrade for Order Flow and L2

Again  this is my personal preference, you should use whatever makes you the  most comfortable and can help get the most information and place trades  quickly. But since I have been asked here it is.

**How to find Good Entries/Exits, how do I make sure my green trades don't turn red?**

I'm  sure this scenario happened to you, it happened to me a lot and I get  asked this a lot in the discord. Your stop loss hits and then it runs.  Feels like the MMs have something personal against you right.This  happens because your entries are bad If you enter close to the bottom  (or top for puts) you are less likely to hit your stop loss. Easier said  than done right? WRONG. All you need is to know some trading basics  here are some:

A  support/resistance will ALMOST ALWAYS be retested. So let's say support  is at $307 on QQQ, and it breaks it. Don't go long yet, wait a bit it  will go past resistance. And then go back to test $307 again, it could  happen once or twice. Then it will either make a move up or down from  here. NOW YOU HAVE A CLEAR DIRECTION, if it breaks through $307 again,  this is where you go long and place your stop loss 10% or 20% or  whatever your number is below resistance. 

Now, do you know why your stop  losses hit? I'll make it simpler, it breaks $307. It's at $308 now, you  pick up calls with 20% stop loss, it goes down to retest $307 and goes  down some probably $306.5 your call are down 20%, your stop loss hits,  the pullback is done, the stock breaks through $307 and runs to $310.  You are posting loss porn on reddit and crying about it. Do this and  this will almost never happen to you again.

VWAP  and 50/200 MA are your friends. They act as support and resistance. So  if the stock just broke through resistance and is running the next stop  before the next resistance is probably one of these. This is a good time  to either trim or exit your position. 

What I do is get 50% out and move my stop loss to entry or a little above it. Now I apply what I wrote  above and wait for the retest if it runs again after the retest you can  move your stops to VWAP/50/200 MA. If it fails get out or let it hit the  stop your call, either way now your profitable trades won't turn into  losers.

**How to Place Stop losses, how to avoid 1 bad trade taking down 10 good ones?**

I'm  more often right than wrong, during this challenge i only had 1 red day  and on that day only 1 red trade that took down the day out of 3  trades. I had 3 red trades in total during this journey. The combined  losses of these 3 trades are around $550. I could have been up another  505% not including the compounding effect from these, if i managed my  losses better. My stop losses sucked. I mean sucked hard. I now got a  lot better at this. Here is how I remedied this and how you can too.

I  see a lot of people pick a stop loss % out of thin air, 20% for example  as I did. While this is all good and well. I found that having my stop  losses at events made things a lot easier. For example, if the stock  broke support, retested, and then fell again. This is a good time to cut  a loser. Or if the trend changes etc ‚Ä¶. If your plan fails, what's  holding on to the stock any longer going to do, at this point, you are  hoping it will bounce back, this is pure luck and/or gambling.

**How do I Position Size?**

This  is something I struggled with at the beginning of the challenge. I'm  used to trading with the main account, making $20 per trade was not  something I was used to, so I slammed full port into 0DTE or next-day  contracts. Very bad Idea. Don't ever do that. You can be right 9 times.  All it takes is one time. You cant average down and losses are huge. 25%  is my preferred size, which is still a bit high (5-10% is best). As the  account grows I'm able to do more, I have multiple contracts so I can  take starter positions and trim. So the solution here is simple, be  patient, do the boring thing so you can do the fun thing later.

\*\*What  is the strategy I use?\*\*The name of the game here is confirmations, all  trading really is at its core is finding as many supporting signs that  give you a direction on where the stock is going. All we can do is find  as many signs as possible to support either a bullish or bearish thesis.  That's it, that's really all trading is, all strategies are built  around that, once you understand that you can make your own strategies  and pick your stocks.

So the  strategy I have been using so far is just that. Now as a rule of thumb  you don't want to be trading against the trend, if the market is going  up you want to be trading calls and puts if it's trending down.

What I do is basically a combination of everything i wrote in the post so far. So for example if

* The stock is at support, pulled back, and broke through support again
* The stock price is below VWAP, 50MA, and 200MA
* There is bearish flow coming in
* RSI is oversold (doubt that happens, if the first 3 are true, but just giving an example)

4 confirmations are telling me, its time to buy puts.

Now  nothing works every time, but I guarantee you that in situations like  the one above more often than not you will be right, combine that with  the risk management outlined above and good entries/exits I don't really  see how you cant be profitable. You

There  are a ton of additional confirmations out there, news, catalysts, L2/L3  (order flow), RSI, MACD, each to his own. The main idea is to have as  many confirmations as you can. Could be as little as 2 but the more you  have, the more likely your trade is going to be profitable.

For  some this stuff is basic, for others its not. But i do know that are  ‚Äúgurus‚Äù out there who charge $xxxx for this stuff. Now you have the  knowledge and you can pick your own stocks using these setups.

I  have got nothing to sell you, and i plan on writing more stuff like  this in the future if enough people like it, so if you gained anything  from this or enjoyed all i ask is please join my sub [r/theashshow](https://www.reddit.com/r/theashshow/) and if you want learn or talk about stocks do hop into my free discord server.

I am very good at not doing stuff. what a load of crap, in bitcoin we trust ultra cringe, did they kick you out of scientology and thats why your here? HODLING is literally the single easiest strategy of all possible strategies. most people struggle with selling and taking profits.

get past your emotion  ... but  simultaneously dont forget to play a bit cult and worship Bitcoin like a deity lmao When dealing with any assets it‚Äôs best to keep emotions out. The only fundamental of Bitcoin worth focusing on is market share. Bitcoin is huge and some argue too big to fail. Other than that? One hour block confirmation time? Huge transaction fees (for small amounts)? 7 transactions per second? If a coin like this came out today, it would be labeled a shitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public dispersed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique in that there are a finite number of them: 21 million.

Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted bitcoin as payment.

The underlying Bitcoin protocol is deflationary because the supply of bitcoins grows at a diminishing rate. The result is that the purchasing power of bitcoins increases over time. Bitcoins may be lost, but they will never be devalued.

Bitcoin is often described Holding is not the best strategically. This is not debatable, it‚Äôs mathematically incorrect. It‚Äôs not even the best safe strategy. It will make you money though.

Holding has never been, and will never be, the best strategy. Not an opinion thing. Pretty easy - Bitcoin is going to $100k - the pattern repeats, everything in between is just noise. Ignore it and HODL. Holding is much more fun when you‚Äôre a miner, keeps growing! [deleted] I would have done way better if I just held my USDC, personally. I sold before the crash got big, then bought in again right before it did‚Ä¶ Hodling is just Hodling not the best strategy

Accumulation of BTC is greater than Hodling Honestly, I struggle with selling, not holding.

Holding is easy, I just throw my ledger out the window. To hodle all you have to do is buy and forget. What‚Äôs so hard about that? Defining local and major tops, taking profits on the way up and estimating the dips to buy back in to accumulate more coin is much harder and too hard for a lot of people because it requires time, knowledge and research. If you really want to HODL get a Nano S and periodically send your BTC to it.  It is just enough of a hassle to transfer it out, but not *too* much of a hassle if you must.. Amazing company with alot of expert and experience team and in this project alot of invester are come here without see the has roadmap.This is one of the most promising and high standard project.This project has great future It's better to keep emotions at bay when dealing with any assets.

10,The BTC dip with Strategy: Stable coin minting,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/t217ix/the_btc_dip_with_strategy_stable_coin_minting/,"Bitcoin value has risen by about $5000 in the last few days placing its current value at roughly 39,500USD. This is good news for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Enthusiasts expect this value to drop even further in the next few days.  While this is a good time to buy BTC, there might be another strategy to employ during this period of uncertainty. This way is referred to as Stable Coin Minting. 


Stablecoin minting involves investing in the creation of new stable coins through a process called staking. The advantage of this type of investment is that the value of stable coins does not fluctuate with the rise or dip in the value of other coins but is rather fixed on the value of assets outside the crypto ecosystem. 

A good example is $USDT fixed to the value of the US dollar. Also, a significantly high amount of profit is generated in the form of transaction fees paid by the system users. 


Combing the stability of stable coins and the profitability of minting can be very low risk and few blockchain platforms like Konstellation.tech offer this service.",19,13,False," Does this enable all forms of minting?

What you do isn't smart with the current crypto and traditional market condition, when this will crash really hard, you will loose almost everything. Don't chase x10, chase consistency, that's the only way you will actually make $$# How long did you try out the different strategies? HODLing is not a short term strategy. If you haven't held for five years you're not doing it right I‚Äôll admit right now that I don‚Äôt know anything about governance tokens, so won‚Äôt comment on whether or not your plan for those is valid. Maybe I‚Äôll explore those. I‚Äôm just wondering how long you really gave alts, memes etc. a solid try. Sure, you see people brag about 10xing in a week or whatever. But maybe that‚Äôs just what they say to hype their token. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

I‚Äôve made bigger $ with 2 out of 5 of mine but I‚Äôve also stayed with those 2 projects since last Sept. Got in at the launch of ArchAngel and I‚Äôm def staying for what they‚Äôre building. Saita needs to get their house in order, but I‚Äôll stay there for now b/c I‚Äôm still up. The rest are young but with utility and purpose. My point, it takes time to build something real. Once you find that kind of legitimate project, you hold. The easiest way to 10x or more is to get into a project as early as possible, then have the patience and guts to hold through all the ups and downs.  2021 gave way to many people false hope of lambo's and becoming millionaires overnight with a $500 investment, but that just isn't how this stuff works....

Thus, my recommendation is to diversify your portfolio.  Pick up a good % of established coins.  Over time you will gain profit there, and you can increase that with staking and LP's.  Then if you really want to get a potential moon shot, do some research and find a new project where you can get in early and invest with confidence that's it's not a rug or honeypot.  Ideally the project will be more than a meme coin and have/be developing real utility in the crypto space.  Archangel is one you look at.  They are early, but they are developing an entire ecosystem of tokens through collaboration with different dev teams.  You could get into Archangel early, but all the other upcoming tokens day 1.  This is my current moon shot. Industrial real estate REIT
Farm real estate REIT
Large cap etf Buy and hold. Thanks me in 5 years. If you want to get rich faster than that, start your own business or get a better job. Hodl Check out what Dinger is working on, a launchpad for meme coins with safety utilities where you get to vote to pull out everybody's value if you think the creators are doing something sus. People who make that overnight 10x are literally gambling, and it's just very small number of them. It can take months for solid FA projects to even go 500%.

I don't think the run of gaming coins have ended though, but may be delayed. Free to play ones like Guild of Guardians, Monster Galaxy are still promising in my opinion. Might take time to have their run though, but that's where patience comes in. A project where you have the ability to vote? Opportunities to invest early? It almost sounds like your talking about ARCHA. A coin where the public voice means something. Being a holder of ARCHA gives you the inside scoop on upcoming pressles within the ecosystem and staking benefits... 2 more projects releasing in the ecosystem this quarter ICP, did me alright for a bit but now I'm in on ARCHA too!",0.9982

10,Staking stablecoins is one of the safest and most profitable forms of passive income.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/umf8d4/staking_stablecoins_is_one_of_the_safest_and_most/,"During this crash, I learned this the hard way. People with a huge amount of stablecoins staked didn't seem to notice anything and didn't panic as much as others. Now I'm not going to put most of my crypto investments into stablecoins, but it would be good to know that a portion of my worth isn't wiped out with each dip.

Here are some of the platforms I recommend. All of these are very safe in my opinion, and you can lower your risk by dividing your entire sum among different platforms: [Haru Invest](https://haruinvest.com/), [Nexo](https://nexo.io/) and [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/).

Stablecoins can earn up a good amount of APY% on these platforms. Would be a great investment to sleep on for a few years and get passive income.",133,97,False,"  \+1 for Haru. I used their platform for staking my USDT for up to 15% APR with lockup. They don‚Äôt use a lending-borrowing model like other CeFi firms like Nexo and Celsius. Instead, they provide high APR through high frequency algorithmic trading with minimal risk strategies. Say that to everyone with locked staking in ust right now Normally I'd agree with you and people should be have some farming or LP coverage in their portfolio. But, stable coins aren't immune to issue. Just look at UST, it's still unpegged. It's a stable coin that is sitting at 0.89 went down to .62 yesterday. Voyager offers a 9.0% APY on USDC, which appears to be quite competitive. This is a joke about UST right? God I hope so lol Providing it isn‚Äôt UST, why people stake some absolute shitcoin stables, when 1-1 collateralised real time third party attestation coins exist, baffles me. You‚Äôre doing it to yourself at that stage. To be honest, I've been thinking of doing this myself for the past month, shifting money from my own bank account, which is yielding nothing, and buying stable coins and staking them. I already do that with other Alt coins, so I might as well use my general account to accomplish this. Spool's original middleware offers some good passive income. From the protocol's premise, where deposits are automatically routed via several yield generators with pre-set risk tolerance and restrictions, a large APY with managed risk can be expected. Dont forget thst diverisfying your assets also applies to stablecoins.

Diversify between all stablecoins and also between platforms.

Dont use  one stablecoin on one platform
Dont use one stablecoin on several platforms
Dont use several stablecoins on one platform.

Have several stablecoins on several different platforms. Easy.

You can easily find a list i personally use 6 different platforms, some more knowm than others and some more risky.

Also most platforms offer a sign up bonus when using a referal, sometimes up  50$ for amou ts below 1k $. Stablecoins is the safest way to make money in crypto. Ever heard of UST? Haru looks like the only thing worth investing in. It feels like Blockfi really just wants $3M+ clients to stake, and I cant find any staking nexo. It seems like it's just a kraken competitor, one I've never heard of but am interested in nonetheless.

Do you do anything else on nexo? Have you not seen UST ? Unless its UST lol I concur.

I stake USDC on crypto.com ha.  you say this immediately after UST depegs, which is the one major scenario that blows up your ""safe"" and ""profitable"" passive income.

Yes, under normal operations, it's very very attractive.  But buyer beware... With the current state of the market, having an alternative means of creating passive income is essential. Because no one knows what will happen next, and from the look of things the passive income system developed by Spool will make it much easier to avoid risk and earn reasonably while the market is down. Don‚Äôt buy UST please The only thing about this that I advise is to diversify into stables. Not one single stable is complete immune from depegging and you need to spread risk as to not get rekt.

You also need to keep an eye during days of market volatility. We had problems in the past with frax, yesterday was UST. The market will soon or later test their peg. Xusd is the one Any profits I take into USDT I immediately put into various platforms to earn interest on while they sit in the side waiting to be reinvested back into dips like we have now. 

In fact I have one platform I get 11% on USDT and 5.5% on ETH and have moved all my ETH trading there, so whatever I'm holding between the two makes me passive money while I'm trading back and forth between the two. Staking is a great way to get passive income. You just lock in and wait for the sweet rewards to mount. I'm staking with $IXS currently. They're based on the ETH blockchain, but they're experimenting with other blockchains like Polygon. Definitely worth checking out. EEUR pool has been my saving grace in this market. I don't have to worry about de-pegging as well as it's backed by bank reserve and government bonds

H2O is another win for me. Ocean protocol backed stablecoins for ocean data marketplace

I held UST during this period well I don't regret it, it gave me good gains careful, only works safely for centralized stablecoins that have backing by companies, otherwise those stables risk to spiral into hell.

each has their own risk, as long as youre diversified even in stablecoins you should come out in a win

I think though staking them on Dexes is best, in LP pools or lending since they are sustainable rates from volume and others that trade, like on AlgoFi,Uniswap or kdx

They are not artificial or loans from banks to be given, just math calculations where the house wins but it also doesnt risk going under Anchor protocol has a 19% for stablecoins. Is it long-term viable? No. However, it would remain at 19% until they ran out of yield reserves, at which point it would drop to roughly 15%. My favorite among stable coins is Tether. This is a stable coin that has successfully proven itself among traders. the problem that remains, what will happen to our coins if we wake up and find these platforms run out of business. I would include Hodlnaut on your staking list... I‚Äôve come to realize a while ago that Nexo is good for Stablecoins, although people might consider the 12% APY very low, but it‚Äôs safe and consistent, Yield app is also another app like that with a slightly higher APY, depending on the number of YLD you hold.

Using Kalmar to farm BUSD as a single asset sure does have it pecks too, with about 20%-50% APY and Kalmar also provides leverage, basically earning passive income on Stablecoins in this market is the right place to be. Spool: Built for the bear

The APY rates being generated based on the yield strategies in the genesis spools that went live last week is enough reason to see why it's more reasonable to adopt diversified yield farming with stablecoins as a strategy for passive income in a bear period like this. Over $65M staked in the pools in less than 2 weeks already indicates that many people have realized what really pays under this current market condition. So true! Stablecoin is great during bearmarket. DCA into your solid projects. I'm keeping my stables for FLD TGE for now. FLUID intends to significantly disrupt the way liquidity works in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Ethereum looks cheap, too. Enjoy the sales! I've been staking PaxG. I wanted to buy some gold for my portfolio and this made the most sense. Staking with stablecoins seemed impossible few years ago but there we go, earning passively on coins that don't change prices due to market crashes. Feels good to stake USDT & USDC on GreenHouse at ~20% APY, also staking BUSD on Donkey Finance. My stables are on Greenhouse dex farming at like 20% and then some tokens like DAFI ATOM are staked as well. I never understood why you guys, when presented with the opportunity to make life changing wealth, instead opt to invest in dog coins and stablecoins. Invest in projects with world changing utility, like XRP and ICP. I was using NEXO for some time as well but I didn't like the amount of centralization. I have more trust in YieldApp when it comes to staking. You can also consider lending as a source of passive income with your stablecoins. I'm satisfied with APYs on Kalmar right now. Passive income makes me forget about this dip, at least a bit. Its true right now but things would change once Honeyland comes in. Honeyland is a strategy and resource management game, open ecosystem and decentralized exchange where developers and studios build tools, games, items and more into the platform that allows for infinite gaming experience. All these features are money-makers of tomorrow ! I'm happy you learned. I have been doing this from the begging of the year myself, preparing for a time like this. Although I use Tetu for stablecoin staking & farming.

All I do now is to claim my yield and sell them into stablecoins, then buy the dips on my biggest bags; DIA, chainlink, etc.

I think with this strategy, I'll be in the market for a very long time. We also offer about 36% to 250% APY when users stake on our platform In the light of the latest events on UST, I think staking algo-backed stablecoins is out of the question for the majority of us from the crypto universe now. 

My way is to stake solid coins with big potential for rise, NGM, OCEAN, H2O... 

If I am not protected by stablecoins peg, what's the reason to lose rising gains from my staked coins? Yes and no, specially as stablecoins aren't that stable this days...  


The lesson I learnt after taking an huge hit on my UST/BUSD farming on kalmar is that great diversification is also really important on stablecoins and higher yields also mean higher risk  


Still farming and staking of stable coins is also a great practice, but as again:  
Diversify diversify diversify! Fuck this post.",0.9998

Starting with hedging my portfolio against the volatility of the market, especially after the recent bear market, I decided to allocate more to $EURST and $USDC since they‚Äôre stablecoins. 

And when it comes to keeping my digital assets safe, I‚Äôm using Vault12 where I‚Äôm able to recover, back up, and provide legacy inheritance for all my digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFTs, other cryptocurrencies, private keys, seed phrases, PIN codes, digital art, and of course, my crypto wallets. 

What are some major points that I should know to stay even safer in the crypto space?",6,25,False," Diversification has been a successful strategy for me due to the high volatility nature of the crypto market, and It is always prudent to select different tokens with different use cases and projects, as I did with FTM for my DeFi token, NII and LRC for my L2 tokens, and SAND and RIDE for my gaming tokens. 

One simply need to think fast to stay safe in the crypto space. Currently focused on staking on Unifarm as they can boast of juicy pools, currently on the DVDX pool as it offers 36%APY. My stay safe strategy is simple. 
I diversify into multiple coins  with good use cases.  It helps my get a piece of em all. 
DOT ADA NEAR TEZOZ etc. 

Also looking to diversify into staking pools too. But am waiting for spool launch since it‚Äôll be easier to use and with their buffer system, fees will be minimal What I do is to make sure my seed phrase are kept safe but also with a family member that I trust. 

About hedging funds, I keep all profits in OUSD, a stablecoin that earns yield while having it sir in my wallet 

For future investment, I'm keeping funds in ETH, MATIC,  NAKA, OGN, NII, BNB and just little in some memecoin. It's a brilliant option with your hedging funds strategy. However, you'll just need to be sure you're on the right asset management platform to help you out with the funds and crypto asset management. In particular I'll suggest it's a self-custodial crypto banking or asset management platform like that of Fireblocks, UnidoEP, Metamask Insto and others Diversification has been a successful strategy for me due to the high volatility nature of the crypto market, and It is always prudent to select different tokens with different use cases and projects, as I did with FTM for my DeFi token, NII and LRC for my L2 tokens, and SAND and RIDE for my gaming tokens. One simply need to think fast to stay safe in the crypto space. Dedicated crypto computer, VPN, hardware wallet I keep my seed phrase in two places and one cant be complete without the other. its stressful but the stress worth it for added security. I also stake to protect myself from making harsh decisions on selling off too easily. My mental health is also something I found worthy protecting, so I engage with my family on GameStar+ for some fun game nights and improve our bonds. Stable coins have helped me hedge my crypto investments.

I also hedge my crypto assets by investing in high-yield long-term investments.

NII from Nahmii is one of my latest acquisitions, aimed at providing a fast and effective layer for projects to build. It is the leading scaling solution within the layer2 ecosystem. In my portfolio, I have a mix of large, medium, small, and micro cap cryptos, as well as a number of portfolios with different use cases. Furthermore, staking my assets is very important to me, and the most recent staking program I joined was the PKR, which I staked on the BSC network at a 20% APY. More importantly, I buy more cryptocurrency when it is on the decline rather than when it is at its peak.",0.9986

But if this is a long term investment as your cap suggests, I would consider investing it all in ALGO. Everybody is sure Algorand will be huge some day and ALGO is still incredibly cheap. It would probably return much more profit than the ones like Solana and Chainlink. All these gems are quite good for investment. However, it will be very profitable adding some metaverse projects like Kotalverse Token (KVT) to the list. If the bear comes to the market propably most of them will heavy bleed, because their marketcap will be moved to BTC/ETH which you don't have Most of these projects are high capped and will only yield little returns but If you're trying to play it safe I think you've got nice picks. 

Unlike myself I like to explore low cap gems, I definitely DMOR before venturing into them.

**TLDR**: Strategies are presented here to create basic positions from which you can explore other new strategies. As mentioned, options strategies allow the creation of positions with the risk aversion level from the investor's demands. Using the strategy as a hedge, it is necessary to consider whether your position is suitable or not.

**Get smarter:** Not any asset has options based on it. However, we can design our own to make contracts that closely resembles an asset we hold with another asset. Of course, the complexity and number of transactions also increase, they reduce profit by cost.

# General Conclusion

One of the most attractive feature of options is that it can be a combination of options or combined with other derivatives to create a variety of strategies. The possibilities for profit can be so varied that almost any investor can find a strategy that meets their preferred level of risk and is in line with the market forecast.

Without options, the strategies are very limited. If the assets are expected to increase, people would buy the stocks; if they are expected to decrease, people would sell them. Choice makes the move from forecasting to a profitable action plan, if the forecast is correct. Of course, the strategy will punish you for incorrect prediction. However, with the correct use of options, the punishment will be quite small and predictable.

In this newsletter, we will introduce some simple option strategies that you can apply easily. These strategies are the easiest to understand and require the least transaction.

# Covered Call Option strategy

>**TLDR:** I have $ETH. I sell options for $ETH so people can buy $ETH when prices increase. I get money upfront. I lose the infinite upside.

## Who will use this strategy?

### Own Asset

You have people who own the asset, say $ETH. In crypto space, we have two types of people. The first type is people who just have $ETH as an investment and keep it in their wallets. I'm looking at you, institutional investors.

The second type is people who are liquidity providers to protocols like HEGIC, OPYN.

### Sell Call Option

For people who are liquidity providers, this is where you will be selling a call option.

Crash course: call option is basically the ability for someone else to buy your ETH. You're selling the possibility for someone to buy this asset (ETH) from you at a different price.

### Example

Let's say ETH right now is worth $1800 and you want to sell this call option. The strike price is $1950 and they have to pay a premium of $100. Let's say ETH becomes $2200.

Because someone bought the call option from you, they can go to you and buy at $1950 because you've already made a promise. The benefit for you is that you received this $100 premium no matter what. This premium is why people want to be option sellers as they get to earn some money.

### How does this strategy help to manage risk?

This is money upfront whether ETH goes to $2200 or ETH drops to $1000. Whatever happens to ETH doesn't matter because I have this $100 upfront.

Index investing is a passive approach to investing. It attempts to generate returns like a broad market index. The involves using a buy-and-hold strategy to replicate the performance of a specific index (which could be an equity or fixed-income index) by purchasing the component securities of the index. ...

The resultant effect of this method of investing is lower management fees and expense ratios (ERs) when compared with actively managed investments. Another benefit of index investment is tax-efficiency, and this is due to fewer number of trades done in comparison to actively managed investments. Index investing is also an effective method of diversifying against risks, hence, its characteristic low risk. 
Blockchain has brought about the creation of several valuable digital assets. Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins are good examples.  Due to the meteoric rise in the value of these coins in recent years, digital assets have become quite a lucrative portfolio for index investing. However, there is an issue of inadequate understanding of the crypto space. To solve this problem and make index investing on digital assets a lot easier, investors should leverage on platforms with the substantial expertise and insight into the crypto space as well as a solid knowledge and experience in index investing to guarantee profit. Beyond the ease, 

it is also less risky. Several platforms offer good ROI, but it is my opinion that Konstellation‚Äôs VegaX is worth considering because of its hassle-free user interface and excellent ROI (Over 30%).

It goes without saying that I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I've been playing with crypto only since march of 2020, and I'm not an expert by any means. But lately, I've been following this strategy and it mostly has turned out well.

So here's the strategy:

1. I normally hold BTC and ETH.
2. I constantly check the prices of other, relatively Lindy, and high-quality assets such as Litecoin or Chainlink.
3. When the prices of LTC or LINK plummet relatively to BTC and ETH (as they do often) I sell some of my BTC/ETH to buy Litecoin or Chainlink.
4. I hold the altcoins for a while and when they go up in price relative to BTC/ETH I swap them for the latter coins.

I'm not saying this is an optimal strategy, but it seems to have worked relatively well for me. I plan to keep doing this for a few months. Later, when the price of Bitcoin reaches 80.000, I'll start slowly converting my gains into other assets (thinking about stablecoins, PaxGold, and stocks).

So what do you think about this strategy? I would appreciate it if you helped me refine and improve it.

Thank you very much!",4,15,False," Generally I would advice against trading crypto. Every time you exchange BTC/ETH for another asset you have to realize gains which incurs a taxable event as well as pay fees and spreads associated with your exchange.

Following the trend is something that most of cryptocurrency investors do. You can call it a common issue if you want, and I believe that all of us have done that at least once. One of the biggest trends right now in the cryptocurrency sphere is DAOs. These organizations are getting a huge appreciation and recognition, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that all DAOs are going to be successful, does it?

DAOs do usually raise funds to achieve a set of targets or to invest in a specific industry, but raising funds isn‚Äôt enough. I mean for a DAO to be prosperous, it has to combine a strong treasury with other characteristics, such as clear goals and plans, well reputation, and the flexibility during different market conditions. BitDAO for example, has been one of the most recognizable DAOs in the market recently as it has one of the largest treasuries in the cryptocurrency scene. 

However, as I mentioned above, this isn‚Äôt the only thing that‚Äôll lead a DAO to glory, but the fact that it‚Äôs clearly set its plans to invest in promising spaces and create long term projects, gave it huge legitimacy. That even encouraged Bybit, which happens to be one of the largest exchanges and DeFi protocols in the market, as it contributes in almost $134 million in its treasury. 

Also the fact that this contribution happens to be in different tokens (ETH, USDT, USDC), gives the treasury a flexibility to adapt to different market scenarios. And this is what I was talking about. One should be looking for projects that tick numerous boxes in order to guarantee positive returns on their money, especially when it comes to investing in trends like DAOs. Even though I believe this year is going to be revolutionary for DAOs, but few are the ones that‚Äôll be able to survive for a long time.",1,9,False,,0.0

I'm really wanting to move to a dollar cost average (DCA) strategy instead of attempting to constantly time the market. 

So far I've mainly only invested in ADA during the dips (which have been frequent recently...). However, I'd like to move to other coins. One way I thought of is investing a fixed amount each month and split it between the top 5 coins by market cap. What are some common DCA strategies or maybe ones that have worked well for you?",0,33,False," Well I usually look at the market in general. If I see that the market is down, I then proceed and invest a bigger sum of money. And when I see that the market is rather high I invest less.

If you set a monthly/weekly budget for you to invest, then it would help a lot deciding where you go bigger and where smaller. I have a bot that auto buys every 3 days. This is DCA ‚Ä¶ only buying dips means your not buying at all on the upswing and missing out on gains. BTW I don‚Äôt sell. HODL. For a while I had $50 in almost every coin that Coinbase supported. Check it a couple times a day and when a coin has equity you sell off the equity (BTC goes up to $54 so I sell $4) and I didn't actually sell, I converted to Dai(I found stable coins ate less of your money on the spread) then if a coin dipped, say down to $45, I'd move the money from Dai. Just trying to keep everything in equilibrium. It's not dca, but it seemed to work really well. I only had about $800 but it grew to about 1200 before I had to sell for some.family trips and events that weren't really under my control. Hopefully when the biotech rally hits in the middle of this month I'll have some liquid funds I can put back into crypto. A technique you can combine in synergy with DCA is holding your coins in interest bearing accounts. This way you‚Äôre constantly lowering you average purchase price by ‚Äúpurchasing‚Äù coins for $0.00. 

If you‚Äôre curious about the rates you can earn, feel free to reference this [Interest Rates Comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/edit) I put together that details rates paid on almost 150 different coins. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. DCA is the best strategy if you stick to it completely, but still I would advise and hedge the risk with options from Siren Protocol

You should always try to minimize your risks, because unexpected things happen in life I DCA 55 dollars every week. 20-20 to BTC and ETH, 15 to various alts I like. I also have a second job, the money from there goes straight into crypto just like any extra money I happen to get.",0.9871

10,Is it time to buy the dip?,https://www.newbiescrypto.com/p/time-buy-dip,,16,29,False," If you believe in something to invest in then the most reliable approach is dollar cost averaging. Otherwise, it‚Äôs really more of a gamble considering all the data points to more errors in prediction amongst analysts and financial gurus than successes. We may never have the right time to buy the dip because we all see things differently. However, before buying the dip, the project use case should be considered because not all projects have a good use case in the ecosystem. Railgun, for example, has been consistently innovative despite the market situation and still maintains a price range that makes it significant due to its strong fundamentals. If there are no hiccups in the way, ZEC might start a bullish run, and it wouldn't hurt to look at projects with strong fundamentals before buying. I'm going to sound like a broken record here but this has to get across to people. Stop buying meme dog coins right now and buy bluechips like Celo and ICP. Projects like these have never been seen at these prices. It's literally a once in a lifetime opportunity. Nope It's the beat time to invest in upcoming and new projects.

My money is on KOL ,the token of an upcoming project called KOLnet that monetizes influencers through whitelists and token swaps for their social media marketing services. Bear markets are made to DCA!   


Smaller, regular investments will get you better average entry points than throwing all your money at this market thats swinging like a tether ball on a rope in zero gravity.   
...tether reference intentional... Buying the dip means different thing to different people. DCAing is still the best strategy to make the best out of bear markets like this. Interestingly, some altcoins seem to be doing quite well in terms of price actions. A good example is Railgun which has maintained a consistent price over the month. I believe it has something to do with innovations it just introduced to privacy in decentralized finance. MKR is another one that has stood out in the market. I believe it is more reasonable to spend on dips when a good resistance has been exhibited to an extent, especially for low and mid caps. Access to good information is what we investors needs to progress financially and generally in life. DCA I think at these levels is an ideal strategy

We all know shorts move much faster than longs (""the red waterfall"").

Even in periods of huge crashes, it can not enter on time and misses the drop.

Bitcoin is almost always either just repeating a pattern it has recently made, mirroring a pattern its made, or flipping the pattern its recently made. That sounds like a lot of possibilities but when you start getting into the weeds you can see where it can occasionally help.

Obviously, I cannot tell the future, but I am using a real-time example here for demonstration. This analysis will be 2 parts; the first part showing a pattern bitcoin made recently on 3hr timeframe. And the second part showing a potential repeating pattern happening on 1 hr timeframe.

[BTC 3hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qi0vYAuK/) the main thing to look at here is the section with 3 green triangles. Bitcoin is constantly printing these, it leads to a ton of head and shoulder type of patterns, but they arent always perfectly horizontal (for example the one I am showing is slanted on an angle).

In conjunction to this, I'll hold my coins in Amber App, which says it gives strong APRs for BTC if held there for a while. They make money via arbitrage. I'm thinking of doing this rather than opt for a lending solution like KuCoin - as it never seems to work for me, loans get returned too soon.

10,Three Simple Options Strategies as DeFi Insurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/rvgeoj/three_simple_options_strategies_as_defi_insurance/,"  We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile). This is not financial advice.

**TLDR**: Strategies are presented here to create basic positions from which you can explore other new strategies. As mentioned, options strategies allow the creation of positions with the risk aversion level from the investor's demands. Using the strategy as a hedge, it is necessary to consider whether your position is suitable or not.

**Get smarter:** Not any asset has options based on it. However, we can design our own to make contracts that closely resembles an asset we hold with another asset. Of course, the complexity and number of transactions also increase, they reduce profit by cost.

# General Conclusion

One of the most attractive feature of options is that it can be a combination of options or combined with other derivatives to create a variety of strategies. The possibilities for profit can be so varied that almost any investor can find a strategy that meets their preferred level of risk and is in line with the market forecast.

Without options, the strategies are very limited. If the assets are expected to increase, people would buy the stocks; if they are expected to decrease, people would sell them. Choice makes the move from forecasting to a profitable action plan, if the forecast is correct. Of course, the strategy will punish you for incorrect prediction. However, with the correct use of options, the punishment will be quite small and predictable.

In this newsletter, we will introduce some simple option strategies that you can apply easily. These strategies are the easiest to understand and require the least transaction.

# Covered Call Option strategy

>**TLDR:** I have $ETH. I sell options for $ETH so people can buy $ETH when prices increase. I get money upfront. I lose the infinite upside.

## Who will use this strategy?

### Own Asset

You have people who own the asset, say $ETH. In crypto space, we have two types of people. The first type is people who just have $ETH as an investment and keep it in their wallets. I'm looking at you, institutional investors.

The second type is people who are liquidity providers to protocols like HEGIC, OPYN.

### Sell Call Option

For people who are liquidity providers, this is where you will be selling a call option.

Crash course: call option is basically the ability for someone else to buy your ETH. You're selling the possibility for someone to buy this asset (ETH) from you at a different price.

### Example

Let's say ETH right now is worth $1800 and you want to sell this call option. The strike price is $1950 and they have to pay a premium of $100. Let's say ETH becomes $2200.

Because someone bought the call option from you, they can go to you and buy at $1950 because you've already made a promise. The benefit for you is that you received this $100 premium no matter what. This premium is why people want to be option sellers as they get to earn some money.

### How does this strategy help to manage risk?

This is money upfront whether ETH goes to $2200 or ETH drops to $1000. Whatever happens to ETH doesn't matter because I have this $100 upfront.",1,14,False,,0.0
10,"Made $10K this week, At What point do you take Profits? What strategies so you use for profit taking?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/oa8x6c/made_10k_this_week_at_what_point_do_you_take/,"Over the past 5 years, I always struggled with taking profits. Often, I end up riding things up then down then back up then down. Idk if its Greed or Fear of Missing out on Potential Profits. What strategies do you guys use to take profits? Anyone here takes a small percentage weekly or monthly? When you sell stuff, do you keep a small percentage like 10-15% just in case the coin pumps later? A lot of times I sell something that hasn‚Äôt been moving for months and then it conveniently pumps after I sell it as if they were all waiting for me to leave haha. 

I watched my portfolio go from $200 in Early December 2020 to around $43,000 during the first week of May 2021 (Thanks to all the Meme Tokens). Then it dropped a lot, but now its recovering. I still have PTSD from the January 2018 crash, but what I learned from that is that HODLing through that crash would have made me back everything that I had if I had faith and patience. I watched the same thing happen again last month. My guts and instincts were telling me to Buy stuff when they‚Äôre red even when they‚Äôre dipping daily. It was hard tbh. 

I remember everyone wishing for low prices and saying ‚ÄúIf xxx goes back to $$$, i‚Äôm buying a lot‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf I bought xxx last month or last year at those prices, I would have been rich‚Äù. Everyone says things like that and how if they bought Bitcoin or any other coin, they would be millionaires, but the reality is that if they bought any coin early, they‚Äôd sell it early or panic sell it at a Loss after any of the annual/yearly FUDs that come and go. 

I don‚Äôt trade on emotions and I am unfazed/desensitized to FUD. I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs part of the issue since I suck at taking profits. Yes, I know that historically things tend to go up if you zoom out, but I lost around a million dollar‚Äôs worth of profits between this bull run and the last one mainly because of my HODLer mentality. I tried switching back and forth between being a Trader and Holder, but I just couldn‚Äôt convince myself to do it. How do you guys do it? Any tips or suggestions or advice? And for profits, what kinda strategies do you guys use for taking them? (A percentage of the profits? Taking only your initial investment?). Don‚Äôt tell me that we Never Take Profits here. 

Holding is easy, Taking Profits is Hard. Looking for Genuine advice.",243,141,False," When you 5 X in a token/coin, pull your original investment out, which will be 20%.

Then start the 30/15 DCA out method.

It goes up another 30%, take out 15%.

It goes up another 30%, take out another 15%.

Rinse and repeat. Only sell 50% ever. Hodl the rest. Worked for me since 2011. Thank Christ I only sold 1/2 my eth ico at $10 ü§£üòÖ Ill hodl for my retirement. Take profits when you are ready.  Don't matter what anyone thinks.  If you want to take profits, do it. Set a goal, and acknowledge to yourself that none of your coins are too sacred to trade. The fear of having FOMO when you take profits and see it pop way up again is super real, but you can't think like that My father-in-law always says if you double your money take half out and don't worry about the rest,  you basically have free money to play with that you never had so don't worry what happens after that.  We did just that in 2018 and I'm planning on doing that this time also. Might just have to hold a little longer because I showed up a little late this run but it will happen. >but what I learned from that is that HODLing through that crash would have made me back everything that I had if I had faith and patience.

What this means is that you are far better off just steadily investing and growing your stack than trading and trying to beat the game. Pick solid platforms with good tech and promising adoption. Buy consistently and just hodl. This is the strategy that just about every successful crypto investor has followed. Before investing always set a profit benchmark for yourself. When you hit don't be greedy, take your profits and move on. I got in on PNODE at IDO level took my profit when it did 10x after the launch. Now I bought some more and added to my bag because I have so much believe in the team. Hopeful I make a 20x from it soon. You can always sell 3%. How about taking cash out to diversify? 

Put some into property to rent out, consider a pension .. both of these are bets against the whole crypto thing crashing and leaving you with nothing. 

Then look for quality alts that are launching or have recently launched (not shit coins for gods sake) and leave them for a few years to see if one turns into 100x or 1000x

Then continue to speculate / day trade. What is your goal? Optimizing fiat or crypto? It's actually a pretty tricky question. I used to trade infrequently, but I would almost always ""win."" If I thought a coin was low, I'd buy and hodl until it went up. If you do that long enough, you'll win most of your trades. The problem is that I traded away a good bit of bitcoin. Buy at $5k, sell at $6. Wait a bit until the market makes sense and buy at $11k and sell at $11.8k. My buy position kept dropping as the value rose. 

I was trading without a plan. I simultaneously made fiat and lost crypto. Now my fiat gains don't cover the crypto I lost. I now have long term hodl positions that I don't trade, and I don't enter a trade unless I have an exit point identified. Hit that exit point and sell without regret. It may go up more, but there are many, many, many other coins out there that can be traded. 

I keep a rough running tally of my tax hit, and set aside 40% of my winning trades for taxes. If I lose a few trades and my tax money is more than the anticipated bill, I DCA that into my hodl BTC and ETH positions. I've been thinking about this a lot also. You have to accept that you'll never sell at the peak. Or almost never. We all know its easy to say ohhh why didn't I take some profits, look at that huge jump, but we forget how we felt at the time, ohhhh what if it goes up another 5x, 10x etc. I'll miss out on all that. 

Ive come to the conclusion that for me I think the best option will be to pick a fiat amount ID be happy selling at. Let's say I know that I could FIRE if I made ¬£500k, then I'll set that ad my figure and no matter what if my holdings hit that number I'll get out.

Also you could choose a figure early and put in some sell orders so that it takes the decision making out of it. Plus it means if there is a huge jump one day and you were busy then your order would hopefully still go through. What has worked for me in the past (and what I failed to do multiple times), is that whenever I think ‚Äúhm, this may be a good idea to take some profits‚Äù, it usually is. 200 to 43k that's amazing! So your original investment was $200? And in 5 months, without investing anymore money, you‚Äôve made $43,000? 

How‚Äôs that possible? Hey OP, if you haven't formulated a plan, I'd recommend you Google trailing stop losses.  Best of luck
  
Edit: use multiple Hey man, I really liked your post, and felt quite the same way. 

Bought a couple ETH back in 2018, and I was like, I hope I'll make a few bucks in a couple of years. I wasn't quite measuring what I was getting into, even though I knew it felt more than right to put some money in.

2 and half years later, I saw my money go up and down on a screen, but I still have a fuck load more than what I put. I strongly believe in ETH, read and understood a lot about it, and I can't really think about selling, even though this cash would help me a lot. Not a very rational decision, but I sort of feel safer still having it, instead of having some euros to spend. I still use it to buy online, a good way to enjoy my profits ü§∑

You don't have to sell if you don't feel like you need it I guess I think if you can grab 20% profits you are good.  I see two strategies.  1).  Get out all together, or 2) sell your original amount and keep the residual stock as ‚Äúfree‚Äù shares I wouldn't ever sell your crypto. To put it in fait and watch it lose value....  That's the whole point of Crypto, leaving the legacy financial system. How many people who got on the life raft getting off the Titanic said  ""How long should we wait before we get back on the boat?"" NONE! This post is sooo me in the same boat! Even reading your comments without looking at who wrote them I kept thinking to myself, ‚Äòyup, that‚Äôs me‚Äô

You‚Äôre definitely not alone and there‚Äôs definitely a learning curve To figuring out a system that works for you and then working that system. 

The comments here have some great ideas though! Never. You just hodl Buddy of mine and I came up with our own calculation for it. Pretty sick.https://i.imgur.com/OYu1TS2.jpg I would have taken some off the table between $200 and $43k, just me though Just a lurker here.  

How do you know about the meme tokens.  What subs to follow. When your coin doubles take out 50% (your original investment). Then the remaining coins are pure profit. Then when that doubles again you can take out 50%. Repeat until you've sold it all.

This is a strategy I've come across. Seems pretty solid. It's none emotional trading, if you stick to the rules. 

Also you're always prepared to buy the dip as you have your original investment back and also profits to reinvest. I like to take profits in three ways: 1. I sell down a portion of my position on an upward trend. 2. I sell half of my position on an upward trend. 3. I sell the rest of my position on an upward trend. After my investment doubles, I take half of the total profit. $1000 turns into $2000? I take $500. I sort of meet myself halfway of taking profits and maybe missing out on more pumps, but also have money on the side for dips. Anyone else have something that works for them pretty well? I'm like you, OP. I don't like converting to fiat. I need a reason or a written exit strategy, so I literally do that. I take a pen and write on an old-fashioned notebook the various exits for each of my token and coin. I do that as soon as I put money in a project. [removed] Always take some profits. If I‚Äôd made $10k I‚Äôd take 2k out into Fiat for example. Just cream some off. I know everyone is like HODL but I‚Äôm too poor to watch thousands of dollars evaporate. I‚Äôll probably never be a crypto millionaire but at over the years you‚Äôll make some decent cash. I don't even pretend to understand crypto. I buy a little now and then, Doge for the lulz and LTC because it's cheap. If it doubles, I sell half and put that money into my Roth IRA. I took profits when I wanted to purchase a puppy for my girlfriend, I sold half of my holdings in April and held the rest. Just take profits when you need them or want to treat yourself to something you usually wouldn‚Äôt buy, that way you see the benefits of your investments in real life. Never, buy something You take profits as you see fit 
It‚Äôs a personal thing My dream is to never convert my cryptos back into fiat. Obviously I would if I need the cash for basic necessities but capital gains are a bummer. I hope someday to be able to buy my groceries with crypto. Keep holding. Just hold. When it seems like it's way too high then sell.

Just. Hold. Imagine if you said the same thing 5 years ago. Had you held til today the difference would be astronomical. 

Just hold. I have the same problem and lost out on a million in 2018 Hold for at least a year if you're in the US. Happens with me as well. I usually see myself riding the dip with the hopes that I'll see a few green candles. These day's I've been taking out my initial investment and letting the rest run its course. Sounds like you need some new goals to bring back the excitement. If you truly don‚Äôt have any personal desires, let your crypto buy you happiness. Build it up and take profits for charity. See how many people you can help, how many lives you can have a positive impact on. Warren Buffet said something to the effect that he measures success by the number of people that you want to love you, actually do. Good luck. I use a strategy with two underlying assumptions:
1) In the long term most major coins will go up.
2) It will be a bumpy road to get there.

I invest, let's say, $1,000 in a coin at $1.00. I set two buy orders:
1) Buy 25% more of the holding at $800 (20% drop)
2) Sell 20% of the holding at $1,250 (25% gain)

Each time an order is triggered, I reset the orders for a 20% drop/25% gain. If a coin goes down 20%, then returns to its original price, I take an overall profit of $50 (5% of the original investment) and still have the same position as I originally started with. It also ensures I always have almost the exact same amount of fiat invested - if I invest $10,000 across 10 coins, I will still have about $10,000 invested no matter how much the coins go up or down.

It's a very conservative system not designed to maximize profit as much as to limit risk and ensure I'm always taking some profit during the good times. But it works for me as someone willing to give up some of the upside potential in exchange for slow, steady gains and something to prevent me from trading emotionally. I used to look for crazy rockets before to make good gains. Then I got rekt, I lost more than 80% of my investments.

  
Since that day, I am only after steady sustainable growth and safety became my priority. And that led me to NDAU, the adaptive currency. I feel so much better HODLing secure cryptos and getting staking rewards, far away from risks and volatility! Have an exit strategy and price target before getting into any coin. Sell small portions at every price target and never sell 100% of it all, always leave a small amount to ride any unexpected gains. DCA in then do the opposite on the way out. - Michelle Whitedove u/Alpha-Charlie-Romeo",0.9999
10,Taking advantage of a bear market smartly does not require gathering additional crypto. You'll also need to enhance your knowledge.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/ur7ncu/taking_advantage_of_a_bear_market_smartly_does/,"You may call the price movements over the preceding six months anything you choose. Even if we've improved slightly in the last two months, we're still on the decrease. But, in the case of a drop, I believe we all know what to do. Yes, make the purchase.

Even if we fall lower, everyone who does that is smart, since no one will notice if you bought at 40k or 47k in ten years.  


However, acquiring knowledge is another thing to do to completely gain from a terrible market. Because there aren't as many hopium-traders during a bad market as there are during a bull market, you can learn the most about the market.

I discovered FLUID, which is an AI quant-based liquidity aggregator that's looking to bring connected liquidity to the industry and the StarkNet Ecosystem, an L2 which I am still exploring.

Asides that, I'm mostly staking and biding my time to buy dips as well as invest in new projects. Actually, it is proven that there are strategies that can be put in place to make the best out of the bear market. Trying to enhance knowledge is tricky considering how far the space has gone.

10,Sell it all?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/uj4ahk/sell_it_all/,"US Tax Question/Strategy during a down market.

Would it be crazy to consider selling all my crypto while I am deep down, harvest the loss for this tax year and rebalance by buying back a very similar but different portfolio?

I know wash sales were a thing last tax year, and I did hear some talk about it going away this coming tax year, but I don't believe that has been put into motion and you can still wash with no waiting period.

I guess I am trying to think of cons other than fees and time. It seems like there is for sure a plus tax break on income up to 3k - assuming markets don't bounce back and I don't have more capital gains to write off by year-end, plus an opportunity to consolidate to core projects.

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated :)

&#x200B;

example of a wash sale and leveraging a loss against capital gains and income for clarity:

I bought 1 BTC for 64k at the ATH, and now I want to sell that 1 BTC at 35K for a loss of 29k, but then take that money and immediately buy back the 1 BTC for 35K for a net loss of 0 BTC, but a capital loss of $29k against this tax season.

That 29K loss can then be deducted for any capital gains to reduce overall tax liability, but if all capital gains are balanced to 0 then you can take a max of 3k against normal income before rolling the capital loss into the next tax season.

&#x200B;

Edit:

Seems like there is a lot of confusion around what I am asking. I am not planning on selling my portfolio and walking away with the loss. No need to respond ""just hodl"" or DCA those are givens. This question is specific to the pros and cons of a wash sale for tax purposes.

Some tidbits I found through his exploration:

""As of December 2021, there is no crypto wash sale rule in place‚Äìyet. The IRS officially considers digital currency to be property rather than a security.""

""Yes, it‚Äôs possible that cryptocurrency could eventually become subject to wash sale rules.""

""Meanwhile, the Build Back Better Act includes a proposal to subject cryptocurrencies to the wash sale rule. If the Act were to become law, cryptocurrencies would be subject to the same treatment as stocks, mutual funds and other securities when applying the wash sale rule. That means cryptocurrency investors could face new tax liabilities when selling crypto at a loss and buying new crypto assets.""

",35,159,False," Buy low, sell high. Is it really that hard? ""any thoughts you have are greatly appreciated""

That was your mistake! These thoughts you are getting are mostly terrible lol

I don't think there is any downside other than what you already mentioned ie fees and time. 

Do a thought exercise, pretend you had sold it all. What would you buy back? How would you reorganize your portfolio ideally? Then just rebalance to hit those %.  That will minimize your fees.  

Personally I've found that once I've sold things (with the intention to buy it back) that I realized I didn't actually want it enough to buy it back, so I didn't and reinvested elsewhere. This game is all psychological. I would also like to know. Average down if you have faith in the project. If not, sell. Crypto wash sales were very helpful for me end of last year.  Saved me fair amount of money in federal taxes‚Ä¶.mostly altcoins that dropped but were projects i still like. if you sell, wash trade, and buy in at the same price it will give you a cap loss in the short term, but if the price goes back up and you sell you will be net neutral (because of cap gains), except you lost time and fees. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but I don‚Äôt believe the wash sale applies to crypto. Technically it‚Äôs not a security. In the UK you have to stay out of that asset for 30 days after selling. I think it's the same in the US.

Up to you if it's worth the risk of a major price move while you're out of the trade. With the state of crypto atm you could probably buy some staked BTC of some kind and call it a different token to get around the law that way. if the ratios are good and you're looking to rebalance coins then it is smart to do it while prices are down to minimize tax costs. or if you have substantial other tax costs that if you sold you could offset and then buy back in more.   


these are the only real reasons (other than no confidence in crypto in which case have fun with fiat in 20-30 years) I don't believe selling is a good idea. Infact, I consider it a totally bad idea. Holding is not a very good one either. I think yield farming is the best option, especially with stablecoins to eliminate the issue of volatility. However, it requires diligence to get protocols that offer good rates. Personally, my stables deposits are in the genesis spools at spoolfi and I am confident of the returns I will be getting. Since it's an automated protocol, I don't have to do a lot of monitoring and rebalancing. For me, it beats the option of holding or selling If you are very much concerned about taxes, then I'll recommend that you start thinking about privacy protocols, especially the ones that are scalable with DeFi protocols like Railgun. I believe if you work it out properly, You'll be able to navigate through the strict tax barriers Wow you are really getting some terrible responses to this question that are not addressing what you actually asked.

I‚Äôm contemplating doing the same thing you are suggesting, but taking losses on some cryptos and buying back with others. I wouldn‚Äôt count on there not being a wash sale rule next year, so wouldn‚Äôt recommend selling your BTC just to buy more BTC.  

You should probably calculate how much expected capital gains you will have this year and offset with crypto realized losses, but wouldn‚Äôt sell too much to go much past the $3k tax loss carryover limit. 

Personally, I am likely to also experience losses in stocks this year so there won‚Äôt be much capital gains to offset by realizing a tax loss, so likely will just hold. It depends what you are holding. If they are crypto tokens erc-20 , bep-20 etc then it‚Äôs risky to hodl.
If you are hodling bitcoin, Eth , Ada etc then it‚Äôs highly likely that they hit ATH in the future. Wash sales rules do not apply to crypto. It's crazy to sell ALL your crypto at this point in time, imo.

I'm holding and staking. This is why I like to go for projects that offer good staking rewards like ATOM, OIN, ROWAN, OSMO, JUNO, NEAR, SCRT.

They only thing that I'd say is alright to sell now are those shitcoins one might have dabbled in and the profits would go into stablecoin staking until the new gems on my radar like FLD and TEAM are up for sale.

Buy high and sell low is the fastest way to rekt city and NOT making it..but you know that already. Simple solution, don't tell the tax office shit. DCA I sold everything at the end of Feb. might buy back in someday but I believe we are nowhere near the bottom yet. Is it the same rule as stock, where you can only claim $3,000 of losses on taxes? Will you think of doing this every time there is a downturn? Keep it and buy another BTC then you will have 2 and no taxable events :) Washtrading is illegal. But besides of that, i would harvest losses now.

Actually I did. Bad idea Don't sell, hold. But if you don't want your crypto anymore just help a bro, and send it to me. I'll be glad to recive that. We're halfway to the next BTC halving. Hold until then if you can. 

I'm US based too. Totally fine with holding long term for the more favorable long term capital gains tax when profits come. Until then, accumulate! Wouldn't you have to eventually pay taxes for your gains when Bitcoin pumps again and you sell? You may want to pay this question in r/CryptoTax

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTax?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share Just hold it mate. Or transfer it to ETH and stake it. It will recover eventually. [removed] Did you expect it not to drop at all?

I mean we've always known that crypto is up and down so it's normal to plan for DCA.

Also with staking, it cushions the blows. Staking rewards from atom, scrt, dafi, rowan, green, osmo, juno is what keeps me going on days like this.

Then once that well dries up, chill with your money and wait until something similar happens with another crypto. This bear market will probably claim a few more victims. But don't start eagerly branching out into strategies you don't know, or start thinking its easy money everywhere.

10,CeFi vs DeFi | Earn more with lending Platforms [strategy],https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/qj3ss8/cefi_vs_defi_earn_more_with_lending_platforms/,"During this run, I'm focused on growing my BTC, So I tested some of the best lending platforms, both DeFi and CeFi; here is the result:

&#x200B;

>**CeFi** \- Hodlnaut ( \~%8 APY for BTC and ETH, \~12% on USDC)

All of my interest is paid in BTC for now. But the time will come when the market sags; it's a part of it. 

At that time, I'll want fiat money for new opportunities to focus the velocity on cash payments. 

So check this out: You can park USDC, ETH, and BTC on Hodlnaut. And, you can get your interest paid in any of the currencies they deal with and, you can direct each of your holdings to pay interest in the currency of your choice.

So, I'm growing BTC at a FAST clip by directing my USDC to pay in BTC and my ETH to pay in BTC. And when I hit my goal on BTC, I'll direct all interest to be paid in ETH.

Here's the fun part, when I direct everything to pay in USDC, which itself grows at 12.5% APY, I'm friggin' growing money.

*Here's a real-life example:* 

My 2 BTC and 20 ETH and 3000 USCD are growing my BTC at just over 1% a month. So that's about 2000 USD per month. 

&#x200B;

>**DeFi** \- Aave/ Compound (\~1% for wBTC and ETH, \~7% for USDC) 

&#x200B;

I deposited my wBTC, ETH on AAVE / Compound. 

Take out a loan for a stable coin (USDC) using my wBTC, ETH as collateral 

Watch as wBTC; ETH goes up while I still have money in my pocket to pay my bills or lend it again for \~7%

The only thing that can go wrong is you going over 50% for borrowing, and we get a hero-level crash. Other than that, it's the smart thing to do for any coin you'll hold in the long term if you think it'll go up more than 10% in a year (borrow APR for stable coins).

You can also get interest on the percentage of your collateral that you don't use to take out a loan.

I've been bouncing the idea around of opening a collateralized debt position with MakerDAO.  Essentially if you wanted to cash out 5,000 you could open up a CDP with say: 15,000 worth of collateral. Then you mint 5,000 DAI, sell it for fiat and now you have $5000ish.  If the price goes up you can rebuy it at that price, if it goes down and is below the over collateralization ratio it would get liquidated and you would have to pay a fee (13% I think).

Starting off with some really basic stuff on the [Total Crypto Market Cap](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zSMqYUxm/). Just wanted to point out a very basic bullish idea. The all time high of the crypto market has been broken and in the last day the all time high has been retested absolutely perfectly. This is a wonderful sign for the market in the near future. Its such simple basic ideas like this Support/Resistance flip with a valid retest that will make so much more money in crypto than the fancy, overcomplex analysis. It's also very possible that we will retest this level a couple more times soon but the important thing to know is that it will provide good support. If you haven't read between the lines yet, I'll make it obvious: If we get a pullback and the Total market cap pulls back to that support, its a perfect time to consider opening positions. But you need more than this one idea, I'll come back to this in a second.

And for the sake of teaching, it's always good to have confluence between multiple ideas. Here is my [USDT Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Z14x4MMu/) chart I shared a few days ago saying we had to keep an eye on this double bottom. The support level I have had drawn had a perfect breakout and retest, and this matched our ideas with the Total chart above. Again, confirms the bullish sentiment in the market.

[Bitcoin Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/akSRW2cC/) is quickly approaching the neckline of the double bottom. Keep in mine, where I put the neckline may not be exact, but there is definitely a resistance zone in that area.  
And a [Bitcoin 2hr](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Jea6hA2A/) chart to compliment the BTC.D chart. A couple days ago I mentioned an upward break of a rising channel is mega bullish. Turns out that was the case, and it even gave us an iconic retest. That formed another rising channel earlier today and that even broke higher and now we are headed to ATH. I'm mostly showing this to display where resistance levels may be for those traders that are looking for small dips to buy in. I extended the rising channels because those will provide support in the event of pullbacks. And all of the dashed purple lines in the background will provide support as well. I even left my alert line on the chart because I'm a nice guy :)

And now we have to tie it all together. I mentioned I would come back to an idea I mentioned in the first paragraph. Find confluence between multiple ideas! Don't buy just because the TOTAL chart cane back to support, that doesnt mean your particular coin of interest is done dropping (maybe yours didnt even pullback!) Find support levels on the coin you want to buy, wait for the pullbacks to line up between the TOTAL (TOTAL2 and TOTAL3 are good too depending on the coin of interest). Look at the BTC.D chart and find its resistance and support. Buy in on confluence and you will not lose!

&#x200B;

Questions welcome. Happy trading!",7,6,True," These are some really cool suggestions and thoughts.Thank you very much!But i knew many of those because of u/moonstake . It's the largest stake pool network in Asia and i get all this information from this platform,looking and analysing the potential of coins/tokens.Apparently,there are more than 2000 cryptos that can be analysed.

Some basic BTC ideas going into the weekend. 

* The descending triangle should break lower
* The rising wedge should break lower
* The descending triangle lower support was regained but with low volume
* If the descending triangle support is lost again, watch for a retest and then a most to the range lows (could be lower than the $27k level I have marked)

Once of my favorite strategies recently has been trading the bull and bear traps. It's one of the highest success rate trading methods I use, it just doesn't happen very frequently being that it is always against the probability. But this idea is shown on the chart with the blue area. On a retest of range higher is where I will be loading with longs, until then just short term trading.

I like it and will continue to use it. The trades have been good and it takes out a lot of the emotion.  I also still have other accounts too. Bots are a bane on the crypto space and should burn in the fires of hell. You can use TradingView scripts on Bonfida on Solana as well. I have seen people getting rekt because they're relying too much on trading bots. Even seasoned traders take up to 8 years learning how to trade with almost $100,000 loss every year before they started to profit. Sure it's hard, but think of it as your enrollment fee before you actually profit for yourself. Try paper trading instead, then start day trading on your own. [deleted] Cryptohopper is great for basic bots using indicators. But right now I‚Äôm using Coygo for arbitrage bots [removed] Has anyone actually made any significant cash trading using bots?

Best Strategy in Crypto.

But when BTC and ETH are 75-85% down

Start Selling when its 5-10x up.

Rinse Repeat. No Bots needed. :) Dollar cost into projects you understand and believe in, and take a long term view that way you are not subject to the ebbs and flows of the crypto market and therefore not over-reacting to it.

Remember nobody who bought Bitcoin 5 years ago has lost money, but those that sold did. It is  very nice project under blockchain technology. I really like the concept of this project, good idea with strong team- We will support this project. I would love a bot but what about taxes with all this rapid succession of buying and selling? bots dont always do their job sometimes they missed a big opportunity. Best to code your own bot so you learn from it. I've code some in python using an api that hooks to over 100 exchanges and also learn different trading strategies and trends such as rsi7 and supertrend. Best bots use a combination of all strategies. Grid trading allows you to automate a crypto grid trading strategy on Binance. I have tested Tradesanta, 3Commas and Cryptohopper with real investments. You can find my detailed reports regarding each tool here:

I‚Äôm reading news about that the MonkeyPoxInu (MPOX) turned out to be a scam, since allegedly the developers ran away with investors‚Äô money which is about $400M.


I honestly think that anyone that fell for this scam was either trying to make quick profits, or they‚Äôre genuinely gullible, I mean I can‚Äôt even imagine what this coin‚Äôs marketing strategy was to attract all those investors. 


We should try and point out obvious scams as much as possible, to help new comers not fall for hypes, and guide them to invest in more community focused projects, like DAO based projects. 


One example is BitDAO that‚Äôs community led, where BIT holders vote on which project to support next, aiming to build a tokenized economy that everyone can become a part of. 


And if they‚Äôre more NFT-oriented they can look into DAOs like PleasrDAO, that aims to collect digital art that represents and funds important ideas, movements and causes that have been memorialized on-chain as NFTs.

11,My (technical) analysis for bitcoin the coming days. Tell me where I‚Äôm wrong.,https://i.redd.it/qpjqr5opnm391.png,,1,49,False," I think more sideways than down for a while Ta is wrong This technical analysis has some sense. I think that no one can predict the market exactly, but from the point of view of  probabilities, it really makes sense.  


Is there any chance to make the similar analysis for Kadena?   
I'm bullish on it, while some people just panic So basically it's either going down or up.

Wow, who would have guessed. How many people/traders do you know that make money trading ""divergences"", ""trend lines"" and lagging indicators like EMAs?

It's all fun and games drawing nice lines on charts and using lagging indicators like EMAs but I literally don't know a single person that is consistently correct using that sort of crap.

There's price action and that's literally it. There is Bullish divergence on the daily. RSI bearish on HTF.  First thing you should always do is invert the chart and check your bias. This is a bear flag consolidating in a box range. The oscillators reset allowing it go lower. Nobody knows exactly what can happen, but from technical perspective you should see more downside in the coming weeks.

And all of the morons who make fun of TA. The Japenese used forms of candlestick trading for 300 years.The Legacy market has people who went to all of the best colleges in the world and have been using western style TA for what 80 years? Trillions of dollars assets have been traded based on it. Literally 70% of the money in the world. So some dumbfuck neck beard can say its a joke, Why ? because he is ignorant. Gain 32k = upwards , Lose 29k = down , all you need to know. Overall on the daily we're still trending down. We just rejected at 32k so that's a sign of weakness. Until we gain anything significant on the upside it's either sideways or down Nice My astrology sign is leo Zoom out. Ta is like astrology for men... pointless I am someone who believes in TA but it cannot be applied all the time.

Too much worry in the world about everything else going on and the hardships that people face on a daily have increased. 

Crypto's not gonna bounce and go to the moon until the stock market sorts itself out as well. So .. it's going to go up or down. Brilliant. My guess is that Bitcoin will bottom 50% higher than the bottom before the Covid bull run. I forget what it was but let's say that was 10k BTC.. so I think in this bear BTC will drop to 15k.

Furthermore.. if the last high was 70k.. I think the next bull will bring it up to 105k

Im trying to save 10k to put in at 15k. Them I'll sell it when it hits 100k ( not to be gready lol)

So in this scenario I buy .75 BTC and cash out with 75k profit. Feel free to check my math.

I'd like to see this hypothetical bottom happen in September. And my selling point be Jan 2023 Is this the same chart from previous months? Your TA forgot to include a potential recession. Forget the rsi, macs, fortune cookie and moving average.   Until it breaks the lower high on the htf she's going down. not gonna comment on TA reading or opinion for now.

but really sorry to say this, the way u draw the trendlines on chart simply indicates that u r not so serious on TA afterall. Wow that sure is a cool looking crystal ball! What goes down must come back up.   You know Build the thing back up better phrase",0.9931

Its an old ass project with little to no community.  So many Layer 1's out there building useful applications; Avalanche, Fantom, Solana, Luna, Elrond Doing TA on stuff like this is pretty useless. A single bad headline sends projects like these to 0 with little hope for recovery. Technical analysis is solely price pattern behaviour right?

So nothing. It‚Äôs a stable coin.  People have no reason to hold it. There is no TA that can be done.

I use technical analysis to choose *when* to invest (and when to sell).

By itself, fundamental analysis works fine, but adding in a little technical analysis can make a big difference.

By itself, technical analysis will usually screw you, because things come out of nowhere. The graph won't warn you about coronavirus or the latest regulations from China or the latest tweets. There's verifiable proof it works for some, but those that don't understand it bash it.

People drawing lines and zigzags with moving averages and seven day calendars, waiting for the stars to align so they could buy into ETH when mercury enters retrograde‚Ä¶ Why do you do this to yourself? You cannot predict the future Nostradamus, so make better decisions for a better time later. This is your only hope‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs not magic, the market builds itself on good projects really. If you look in retrospect, yes you can see pump and dumps, but in the long-run, only good ideas prevail. And the sooner you buy, the more you earn potentially. So instead of drawing pastel lines at graphs, go buy in some small projects, like Royal Falcons Club for example, and save yourself the embarrassment. 

Buying early has always been the way how people made it BIG. And I mean big big not just a few pumps into their portfolio. """,0,21,False," A good tech analysis is supposed to use historic and present data to deliver an educated analysis of what is currently happening in the market. A Prediction based on that data is still just a guess. In crypto these analyses are mostly hot air since BTC controls everything. When BTC is stable you can pay attention to the purpose and development of the project you want to buy into but no matter how bullish you become, BTC can shit on your dreams. Technical analysis is much more than what you have described it to be. Trend lines and moving averages are jus the tip of the iceberg. Technical analysis includes many different methodologies and tools such as  Elliot Wave Theory, Fibonacci Retracement, Bollinger Bands, Ichimoku Cloud, etc.

The technical analysis conducted by many YouTubers, and those presented in online news articles, also typically only use the most basic methods and tools. The technical analysis that investment banks, private equity funds, commodity traders, and those with a Bloomberg Terminal can conduct is much more sophisticated.

Your critique of  technical analysis not being magic  because in retrospect it only points out the obvious is a post hoc ergo proctor hoc argument . Without t technical analysis there is no way to prove that in retrospect  it is as useless as you suggest  it to be in predicting price movement.

Also it is important to note that technical analysis is not used to measure the quality of a project, it is only used to analyze price charts. Suggesting otherwise only creates more confusion of what technical analysis is. As such, the most important thing to probably know about technical analysis is that it is used primarily by traders to make  decisions on when to open or close a position. Traders are not hodlrs.   Investors on the other hand are hodlrs and care about the quality of a project and getting in early. Traders make their money  in crypto through price volatility while investors make their money from successful good crypto projects.",0.9481

I just don't get how all the f*cking alts are related to BTC and the supports can be broken in a click of a finger. For example ALGO and XRP were consolidating above a strong support and then pluff down she goes.

I think it's best to focus like 70% on fundamentals because the crypto market doesn't behave like the stock market.

Will there be a day where BTC is no longer like the NASDAQ or S&P500 indicator for the stock market? Will TOTAL2 (crypto market cap excluding BTC) be the new indicator for alts at some point?

I mean I have things to learn as well, like do a more spread out DCA or maybe take profits when there are a few bearish indicators, but I mean BTC is not like many other alts and if BTC goes to 0 other alts could easily take it's place.",2,9,False," I tend doing the opposite: trying to understand crypto, TA is worthless Eventually some alts will stop behaving like btc, but that is a long way away from now. 

It has to do with market sentiment, btc is seen as a relatively safe asset and if that dips significantly it means it's probably time to pull off some positions. 

And it is simple to conclude that due to its large market cap it is harder for it to fall by much, cintrary to most altcoins. 

Also check the stocks market as it does carry much weight in what happesn in the crypto sphere. 

And lastly check btc dominance, you will see that everytime the market crashes it goes up, proving that people consider btc the better place for their money to be during uncertain times. Most coins are still heavily tied to BTC's balls. Doesn't matter the leadership, project, vision, or support. If BTC crashes then they all crash harder.

One day they'll be able to stand on their own but it hasn't exactly happened quite yet.

Lastly, BTC is heavily manipulated so even BTC's technicals can be hit or miss. FUD, rules and regulations, rumors, inflation, economies. All of it affects BTC.

Best thing is to be prepared for both upside and downside and manage your risk by keeping it minimized. Do your own research and don't listen to some claimed prophet saying BTC will be $450,000 by Wednesday. For everyone who needs to hear this - technical analysis is bs. Have a great day.",0.9265

11,Technical Analysis Breakdown: ETH using Accumulation/Distribution and Anchored VWAP,https://i.redd.it/0wy7n03abjf71.png,,2,3,False," *This is a weekly chart of Ethereum looking at the price history since late 2019. As you can see, there are quite a few numbers on the chart showing trend reversals and price levels being respected using the ‚Äúquarter-to-date‚Äù anchored accumulation/distribution indicator for trend changes and anchored volume weighted average price (VWAP) for supply and demand levels of interest.*  
1. This number represents the anchored VWAP starting at the November 2020 breakout through the ascending triangle. This area is important to anchor from as this was a ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù change in the trend for continuation to new highs. As you can see, the price respected this level multiple times on the way up to the all-time highs in May of 2021.

  
2. This number represents three different times since late 2019 in which the quarter-to-date ‚Äúanchored accumulation/distribution‚Äù indicator flipped back to green after being in red. This indicator is a new tool on TrendSpider that allows you to see the flow of money from the start of each quarter or other event on the chart. This is using the ‚Äúcontinuous‚Äù feature which allows you to see the accumulation/distribution from each quarter rather than just the most recent quarter. Notice anytime this indicator has flipped to green, this has been the start of a larger move up.  
3. This number represents the price bouncing right at the anchored VWAP in July of 2021 and being a strong reversal point for the price to hit the anchored VWAP from above from the all-time highs. This phenomenon of price bouncing back and forth between two anchored VWAPs is called the ‚Äúanchored VWAP pinch‚Äù.  
4. This number represents the all-time high anchored VWAP which initially acted as a level for the price of Ethereum to cool off as the price moved up to the average price per coin since the May highs. This VWAP initially acts as a level for the price to pullback because as people start to breakeven after being in a large drawdown, they exit and add supply onto the market. Once the market can digest this supply, the price is able to move up through this level and cause the anchored VWAP to turn to a positive sloping line. [removed]",0.9509

Also, for the past 11 years it's been moving in roughly 4-year cycles, following the btc halving event.

If you're worried that the market is in danger or bought at the ATH, don't be discouraged and hold your position. Take a look at the dates February 9th and February 27th, a chart pattern formed called a bull flag.

The sell off that began this patten, where I circled, equals a 23% dip. Once the flag formed, we had a massive bull-run which nearly doubled the crypto economy. During the last couple days, there was a sell off where the top was approx. 1.725 and it bottomed out around 1.307 trillion thats about a 24% dip.

This is normal. From my analysis, I could tell that we are actually in very good shape. By mid-March we should start seeing new ATHs, as far the market cap goes. Possibly sooner.

We are searching  for people who have some experience with technical analysis based  trading or are at least experienced with paper trading.

12,MINTING ARTICLES AS NFTs WITH COPYRIGHT EMBEDDED TO BUILD AN OPEN ACCESS EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE - SEEDBOMB ASA ALGORAND,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/t3qv7p/minting_articles_as_nfts_with_copyright_embedded/,"Hey everyone, 

Hope you‚Äôre good! We wanted to get some feedback on the latest step for our project, which we think gives a pretty interesting use case to a cryptoasset based community. 

**Background**

In our White Paper and website you can see that we are intending to build an open access educational/ media resource, called the SeedBank. The SeedBank works as follows: 

1. Authors suggest possible article ideas to us for review; 
2. We confirm that the idea is feasible and negotiate the amount of Seeds they would receive in exchange for the article. They then begin writing; 
3. Author produces the article and shares the proposed final version with us for review; 
4. Edits are suggested and made; and
5. Having confirmed it is suitable/ meets the standard required, we exchange the article for Seeds. 

The SeedBank provides a great opportunity for anyone interested in developing their reputation as a writer to be able to produce articles while gaining exposure and publicity. The accessibility of the SeedBank also helps those without funding or the licenses required to access high quality research materials for free. Unlike many other resources which require you to purchase memberships or have institutional access, we are not behind a pay wall. This will help to remove an unfair barrier to education. 

This achieves two things: 1) it gives further utility to the Seeds as an exchange for value (both monetary value and the value placed on the right to vote in the giving process) and 2) it enables us to draw advertising revenue from the website through providing open access, high quality material to the public. This will make our community more diverse and resilient, and also generate revenue which can then be used for the further development of the SeedBomb ASA token.

**Update** 

Alex from our committee has now produced the first SeedBank article which is ‚ÄúReforestation ‚Äì An in-depth introduction‚Äù. Alex is in the process of completing his PhD, so it is little surprise that this article is well-researched, well-written and provides an excellent resource for anyone trying to access Reforestation materials. This is the first of many articles we hope to produce as a committee on a range of environmental topics, including, among others, ecological regeneration, climate change, financial sustainability and changes in law. For this to grow quickly, we will also need to draw in other writers. The first article can be read [here](https://www.seed-bomb.com/blog). 

**Why we mint articles as NFTs?**

We have minted the article as an NFT for the following reasons: 

1. **Proof of Ownership -** We can prove online ownership of the original asset. This means that when we build up a reserve of them, they will derive their own value as an asset, which can then be sold on, leveraged for advertising or, hopefully when banks allow it, used as collateral to borrow against. 
2. **Copyright -** Each of the NFT articles we buy will have the confirmation that they carry ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù as part of their attached notes. This enables the owner as well as any prospective purchaser to have the comfort that they can prove NFT ownership as well as copyright ownership together, in one place. This adds long term value to the asset. 
3. **Transparency -** Our Community Members can see which articles we own by searching them on their favourite NFT provider on Algorand. If you‚Äôd like to see this article as an NFT, you can see it [here](https://www.nftexplorer.app/asset/633144945). 
4. **Author Royalties -** Many authors do not earn royalties when their online materials are sold and often their articles will be used for free. We feel this is unfair so any non-committee authors will also receive royalties on a resale of the NFT to recognise the effort that they have put in. By using an NFT that is smart contract backed, we can make this process trustless and remove the need for the original author to enforce their rights expensively in a court. We have not included royalty payments on our committee NFT articles because we have control over the first sale and can choose to add them at that stage, if it is in the best interests of our community.

We are not aware of many in this space using online article production in this way and believe it is a unique selling point which further builds out our community and adds utility to the token. 

We have updated our White Paper to confirm this, which can be found [here](https://www.seed-bomb.com/_files/ugd/0f8988_0c6d4bd7c0aa447287f7856228a61191.pdf), as well as our Website, which is [here](https://www.seed-bomb.com/). 

**Why does this matter for a SeedHolder/ Community Member?**

This improves the prospects of holding the SeedBomb ASA and adding liquidity in a few key ways: 

1. **Increased Liquidity Through Revenue -** The range of high-quality materials we aim to produce should pull more people to the website. We think that this would make it an appealing place for third parties to advertise, for a fee. The intention is that the advertising fees levied on the site will then feed back into the SeedBomb ASA token. 
2. **Increased Utility of the SeedBomb ASA ‚Äì** We already have our quasi-DAO structure as part of the giving process. What we are now doing is further showing the utility of Seeds, by using them as payment for NFT articles. We also think that many of those who write articles will retain their Seeds to participate in voting, as it is an area of interest for them.
3. **Increased Advertising and Reach Outside of the Algorand ASA Space ‚Äì** As we include more authors and advertise to high-quality contributors, we expect to see an uplift in engagement with people less familiar with blockchain generally and Algorand specifically. The more of this we do, the more we pull people into this space and familiarise them with the excellent work of Algorand and the other ASAs here. This is not just a benefit for SeedBomb, we think this can benefit the whole ecosystem. 

**Next Steps** 

We are preparing a pro forma to make the process of applying to write for the SeedBank seamless. We will aim to release this over the coming few weeks. 

As always, any feedback would be greatly appreciated - we are always looking to improve! Thanks very much for reading!",2,5,False,,0.0

12,How Does A Seed Phrase Work? (EDUCATION FOR SECURITY!),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/rv4nif/how_does_a_seed_phrase_work_education_for_security/," 

\*\*Disclaimer, this is a sensitive topic, please only comment if you know exactly how to keep yourself and others safe.\*\*

This is a question, not an answer.

I've always been told to have a ledger/trezor and to keep my crypto on there, or link it with metamask.

Then there is a case where someone would say that IF your seed phrase is exposed, you will likely lose your crypto. I want to know how, I did not bother getting one because I hardly have any crypto, but till recently I decided to get one as it became the industry norm and protect my last 1k remaining shitcoins.

IF a microphone, camera or whatever catches a seed phrase and exposes it, how can that put me at risk?

For example, someone finds the words, what can they do? Do they go to a specific website and input it and it will auto find which wallet it's attached to?

Or is it a case where the person also needs my hardware device or access to metamask to use the seed phrase?

With this info, those with people with seed phrases will have a better idea of how to protect their assets as they will know how society's low-life thieves operate.",3,22,False," Let's use Bitcoin as an example. When you buy BTC the Blockchain creates an address on the ledger with a record of how much BTC you have to spend. That wallet is actually part of a public/private key pairing. The public key is the wallet address and it us intrinsically linked to the private key. You cannot guess the private key by knowing the public key, i.e. it cannot be brute force hacked.

Typically you BTC on a central exchange and then send it to a wallet app. Now when you spend BTC, you go to your wallet app and create a transaction. Before the money (crypto) can be spent, the wallet has to prove it has the authority to spend that BTC. It does so by signing the transaction which is done with an algorithm that uses the private key. The private key (or keys)  is what is stored on the wallet app, not the crypto or the record of the crypto you have. Once the transaction is signed it is sent out into the big wide world and verified back the blockchain validators before a record of the transaction is added to the blockchain.

The keys are produced as a pair using an algorithm. The algorithm typically starts the process using a number. The seed is a written representation of that number. It is easy to write words without mistakes than it is to write a very very long seed number. The seed phrase is converted to a numeric representation and used by the algorithm to create the blockchain address where your crypto record is stored (public key) and the key to prove you own it (private key).

The seed phrase can be taken by someone to their own phone or computer, entered into the wallet app using the seed recovery process and bingo they now have the authority to transfer your BTC to their own wallet. They do not need access to your hardware wallet, phone or computer.


Never ever share your seed. If someone asks you for it they are a scammed. There is 0% chance someone asking for your seed is legit. Those words are used to generate wallet addresses and their private keys. It's basically all just a math formula using that seed phrase to all your wallet private/public keys (public key= your address. Private key= the key that controls the assets in an address. Someone gets this and you're done. Everything go e.)

So even if you're using a ledger or Trezor... If someone gets your seed phrase they use that to generate your private key and they can do whatever they want with your assets.

All your hw wallet really is is a device that stores your private keys and can sign transactions. Nothing is stored on it. Everything is on the Blockchain.

If someone else gets your seed phrase they can generate your private keys for all the wallets generated from it. Meaning they can move all your money to their account and you're fucked.

So yeah, from experience I would recommend never typing your seed phrase into your computer ideally. I got hacked years ago when a undetected Trojan somehow detected that I was copying and pasting my private key on my PC. All my assets instantly were stollen and moved to a new wallet I couldn't access.

Never take a picture of your seed phrase, never email it to yourself, be very careful. I keep mine written in a few places (hidden) and I use a cypher or some trick to jumble up the words as well.",0.9338

Please people, please stop feeding them with attention, clicks and your time. Let their own incompetence be their downfall and let people like the aforementioned blockachain pionners and many more that we know exist, provide the appropriate counter arguments.",1098,146,False," only a small handful of society is reasonable people. but, popularity can be a good driving force. Easy, when you're one of the richest men in the world, people listen to you. Regardless if what you're staying is true or not. Many new people in the space that don't even know the Giants in the crypto world, but who know Elon's name. Because most people believe the ""get rich quick"" scheme, why study and understand something when I can just invest in the funny name coin this is the first post ive really respected for a while. lets not even utter their names! The more I listen to musk and Saylor the more I think monero is what Bitcoin was supposed to be. Dividing and conquering, blockchain is going to poop if we do the triple spidey meme among each other. It seems to be related to the amount of kids that have come into crypto to trade shit coins they had shipped on social media/ YouTube. It's like the average age of the whole community has been dragged down. Make antonopoulos great again I think I know why. People like Vitalik have hard time making their thoughts and visions mainstream. Just recently he posted a new article on his Twitter account trying to discredit Musk‚Äôs claims of DOGE‚Äôs scalability. Musk just spewed some dumbness out there like he always does. Millions of likes because it‚Äôs inspiring to them. Of course, none of those millions have any idea what it takes to scale a token. 
Vitalik takes that tweet, posts into the paper and quite elaborately disproves the idiot... however.... I‚Äôve read the paper and keep in mind, I‚Äôm not a newbie to the blockchain technology neither am I an expert... I understood only about 25% of that sh... (pardon my language). I got the idea that Musk is dead wrong but I can‚Äôt even explain to myself why the heck he‚Äôs wrong just based on that paper. I have a higher education, mind you... 

So, how can we expect a new generation who is growing up in quick tweets, Instagram pics etc. to understand any of that and even to start giving a f... (pardon the language again). 

I respect Vitalik deeply but he needs to think of how to bring his thoughts and ideas into the mainstream world. Otherwise, buffoons like Musk will dominate and influence the market any chance they get. 

His Dad seems to be a bit more mainstream but they don‚Äôt seem to be working together. Is blockachain the blockchain 2.0, did I miss something? I've been sending hoskinson videos to friends for over a year. One buddy came back and was like wow that was super interesting. No one else watched the videos.. This right here! Thanks for this post It's so beautiful to see people realising such high quality pieces of info. But i wouldn't blame the dump on elon or anyone for that fact, that's just normal after such a successful bull to drop, it happened before and it'll happen in the future specially if we won't invest in crypto aiming to create an infrastructure to include us all since there is space for everyone. My best wild guess is that zenon actually is so scandalously filling in between those gaps that might actually do this Does anyone who actually claims to know about crypto trust someone like Elon over Vitalik? When Dogecoin started to pump I would say. Antonopolous is one of the most biased delusional people in the space

He‚Äôs well educated on crypto and all things Bitcoin but he‚Äôs completely hell bent on the narrative that Bitcoin is the only thing that matters 

At least people like vitalik are realistic and open about challenges and how the future is likely to look - acknowledging that there‚Äôs pros and cons on both sides I still like the elegance and conciseness of the original paper that started it all. It's less than 10 pages.  https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

I can't imagine the US government creating something like this. It would probably be bloated, thousands of pages of legalese, tons of backdoors for corporate, banking, federal agencies and other law enforcement. When Andreas sold out to the store of value cultists. The real powers that be use these Celebrities to manipulate the market as they need to. Get in Get out, get back in. IF we can remember these are the same celebrities that said not to long ago that they wouldn't invest much into crypto ! it's too volatile. Then when ""we "" the tech supporters kept it going, they eventually had no choice but to pay attention and get in. Not giving them any credit for jumping on the bandwagon now and definitely do not care if they dump or buy either. I‚Äôll probably get downvoted to hell for this but I wanted to share a perspective from someone on the other side of the argument. In 2020 we went from a dual income to single income household, my pay took a significant cut, and we moved to a much more expensive city due to my work. We were by no means living on the streets but we definitely had to pick and choose what we spent money on. In early 2021 I decided to use what little savings I had left to start investing in stocks and crypto. I started with diverse portfolios for stocks and crypto but a particular memecoin I invested in rapidly made my investment worthwhile. Then I decided to sell everything else that was in the red and invest more into the memecoin. In just a few months and with a few thousand dollars I made about a third of my annual salary. I sold half of my coins and used it to pay off my car and pay down my credit card debt. Whatever cash was leftover got reinvested into stocks. All I‚Äôm saying is there‚Äôs no way I could‚Äôve achieved that so fast with most other coins. While I understand why some are so heavily invested in more established blockchain coins, I think a large portion of people in meme crypto are invested to supplement their income and they see it as hopeless to invest into something that they‚Äôll only be able to own a fraction of a share. I‚Äôm sure I left some stuff out and probably have some errors but I‚Äôm typing this while I get up and get ready to start my day lol. 

TLDR: People like me invested in meme coins because we‚Äôre broke and it‚Äôs making us money. Thanks for your time Some of you seem to think that the market would just keep going up if Elon Musk stopped tweeting. That couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Don‚Äôt mix that Marketing shill Hoskinson with Vitalik or Andreas thanks Don‚Äôt you know Vegas Dave & Charles are bro‚Äôs and Vegas Dave has quadrupled his investment in ADA?! Lol he even went so far to photoshop himself in a picture with him. Times are crazy now but you are not wrong, it‚Äôs easier to listen to a guy like Dave than a true knowledgeable person like Charles because money & IG pics speak louder than words. Yeah billionaires don't know how to make billions. Exactly society has stopped being rational. It‚Äôs basically just the DOGE imbeciles. 

But yeah, Musk and that tool bag Cuban need to go away You know Elon is anti-crypto ever since he started backing Doge. He doesn‚Äôt seem to promote the idea that crypto is an anti-bank and fiat currency and so by supporting Doge, you disqualify crypto to be taken seriously by the general population. When the bull run began and moon boiz got all over the crypto subreddits. That appears to be a challenge of some sort. 

Yes? Elon told me to sell and now I‚Äôm poor Money Bro, swing and day traders is why. If you are holding long, I am glad you have a strategy... but a lot of us trade crypto in different ways and signals from anywhere can be great opportunities for income. What do you mean on something that could result in a major fork.... for btc? Or eth? You're right! From now on I'll only listen to Bezos's tweets. Logic goes out the window when there is greed beside the developers and some long-term visionaries, most people who are in crypto are in it for the short-term unfortunately. currently, being rational is not the prevailing philosophy guiding the new investors. trying to get rich fast is, which is kinda sad given the real future potential of cryptos. I have learned that most people are idiots LOL blockAchain We? Look at politics, it‚Äôs the exact same thing. I agree though, we shouldn‚Äôt be listening to celebrities who know nothing relative to the actual developers. Preach brother! Werd Couldn‚Äôt agree more You would not have market trends if people would not follow others. Whit out patterns say hello to randomness. When elon started shitposting and the masses decided to listen to him instead The answer is. Greed. I‚Äôm interested to hear from people like vitalik and other top developers take on Solana with their proof of history consensus mechanism. Because we love the dip. We embrace the dip.  Most only adopted the dip.  Others came from the dip! Because you all are greedy MF who claim yourselves to be smart-genius or things like that investors stuff. People would much rather watch the media when research When do people admit they were wrong about Richard Heart and Hex? Does Hex have to make it into the top 10? Does it have to worth over 20 billion dollars in market cap? I remember just about every mainstream influencer in crypto with all their ""expertise"" call it scam not one apologized for their bullshit.

Guardian Token, the ERC20 token that powers guardianplatform.io, has announced a collaboration with industry leader Benzinga on the data analysis of an ongoing set of crypto and digital asset surveys.

Benzinga is a global powerhouse of approximately 25 million monthly readers and is a hub for actionable information on capital markets.  This collaboration with Guardian Token & guardianplatform.io will help to provide valid and relevant data points directly from real cryptocurrency and digital asset investors to the Guardian program management team.  This data will drive the ongoing and future development of guardianplatform.io to provide real world utility solutions to all investors for some of the biggest issues within the crypto and digital asset space, thus improving the overall user experience.

Guardianplatform.io recently launched as an MVP (minimum viable product) crypto and digital asset research and education platform.  Even in it's initial release state, the Guardian Platform is capable of competing with some of the most used research and education platforms in the space.  Here you can find up to the second token data, market news, top gainers & losers, in depth token data with links to official project channels, CEX & DEX information, and more.  However the similarities stop there.

Additional features within guardianplatform.io include the G-Hub, a community based directory where organizations and people within the crypto and digital asset space can collaborate, share, learn, find services, and make connections.  There are also partnerships with Scratch Engine (NFT Evalutation Tool) and Sharity (Crypto Charity Platform), and an affiliation with FEGex already in place.  Looking at ongoing and future development within the Guardian Platform, components such as Technical Analysis, BrainStem, SpyDr, Whale WatchR, BagTrax, Herald, Genalock, Risk Assessment, and Token Strength will be key aspects of this user-focused platform. These components will enter phased development cycles based on prioritization, and two (BrainStem and Technical Analysis) have already commenced.

The results will be a fully integrated SSO (single sign on) capable of managing all your crypto currency and digital asset research and education needs, thus making guardianplatform.io a true powerhouse tool for investors throughout all sectors of the crypto and digiatal asset space.

The current open survey on guardianplatform.io is focused on Crytpo Currency and Digital Assets.  Future surveys being developed are:

Q2 2022 - Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT's)

Q3 2022 - Gaming

Q3 2022 - Digital Identity & Security

If interested simply go to guardianplatform.io to take the surveys.  While there take a moment to see what this project is building.  A tool built by investors for investors is a powerful thing, and this collaboration with Benzinga will put the Guardian Token and guardianplatform.io over the top!",11,16,False," This Is Huge, Awesome News!

And this is really a proud moment because even well-known crypto pioneers and influencers such as Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, and David Wachsman participated in the private VERSE sale. VERSE will be available as an Ethereum-based (ERC20) token with cross-chain compatibility. It is  intended to help the firm expand by rewarding VERSE customers for using the various services available on Bitcoin.com. Benefits include paying the cryptocurrency community with VERSE for activities such as buying, selling, and trading digital assets.",118,26,False," Bitcoin [pros](/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/uop6vs/what_are_your_thoughts_on_bitcoincom_completing_a/i8fun5d/) & [cons](/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/uop6vs/what_are_your_thoughts_on_bitcoincom_completing_a/i8funj7/) and related info are in the collapsed comments below. Pros and cons will change for every new post. Are you telling me Roger Ver made a VERcoin!? Boy did I just click on the wrong timeline...  Is Bitcoin.com legit? It's interesting that bitcoin.com will be launched on Ethereum. Bitcoin.com started out as a bitcoin web portal, wallet developer, and financial services organization, and it still is today.  I like it because unlike many other crypto casinos these days, Bitcoin.com accepts FIAT payments. Their customer service is typically slow. To be fair, the wallet itself is pretty handy, even with a spammy ads here and there. I think Verse made a good decision on this. Unfortunately, there is no way to properly monetize a wallet, which is why wallets either sell their customers out or are abandoned. bitcoin.com is a misleading scam site and it's far away from being any sort of official authority regarding bitcoin (as the domain name might suggest). That is impressive from my point of view. Bitcoin having a reversal in terms of price is also expected. My thoughts also on Syscoin with their recent partnership with DeNet might create a breakout opportunity for a price reversal. Some customers are concerned that listing a fraud will tarnish the image of the only website keeping their investment afloat. Many casino lovers may be unaware that Bitcoin.com has a casino. One has to be careful too as Bitcoin is at the (very) ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù end of the investment spectrum. Regrettably, Bitcoin Cash has become a lightning rod for targeted propaganda.

. The students there need a better curriculum, access to clean running tap water in schools and teachers that know what they're talking about. Ethiopia is irrelevant since it's going straight to a failed state territory.

 This can be a good or a bad thing for crypto, nobody knows. Maybe Cardano could feed the ethiopians instead.  Last I saw they were rather lean as a people.

Conditions are as below:  


1) Should be low cap sub $30-$100M market cap. This is subjective and not the holy grail, if the project is like good a lower or higher mcap is welcome!

2) Should have solid(verified) partnerships.

3) Super strong team(product, engineering, marketing) with solid credentials(educational background, experience, etc.)

4) Do they really need the blockchain? Couldn't they offer their services without a token?

5) Solid Tokenomics 

Not necessary but good to have: If the project has active user base/active app/active product.

&#x200B;

Let's bring it on!",26,70,False," RBIF is definitely a gem! RBIF it is! Robo inu finance has 25 million market cap. Tokenomics- 10% sales tax ( 3% goes to holders,7% marketing wallet) and a 4% buyers tax ( 1% to holders, 3% to marketing wallet) The development team is the best in the businesses , with Vy leading the charge. She used to be apart of saitama then left to start this project up. RBIF looks solid for 2022, very worth checking out I got rbif. Think it could be the new shib Lol at people posting actual shitcoins underneath this.. Reddit investors When it comes to low cap gems, strong teams, excellent tokeconomics, and partnerships, this is obvious in the use cases of projects like Aave, Cosmos, and Spool, which aim to establish a profit-maximizing and risk-reducing yield platform for Defi aficionados.
It's not a bad idea to have a glance. I will say UPBOTS aside their token  there have many partnership, have trading bots for Dex and Cex, offer staking and referral program as well. Smells like RBIF shills are out and about. I remember when Jasmy shills did the same and it tanked in price shortly after. Same with Akita Inu and other shitcoins. Polyswarm. I'm heavy into RBIF and LRC! XPRESS

1. Less than $5million market cap, 2. partners with binance, polygon, gates io etc, 3. team is good and mostly from India and Europe and having very good history in the space, 4. they are all about bringing crypto utility to people everywhere with the cryptoxpress app, 5. 10million total supply with investors token vested Yes, you are right OP. Similar to what I look out for in a token before investing. Low mcap, team, real usecase and utility. For instance project TXA, have solid team behind, and they offer DSL(Decentralized settlement layer) to exchanges, which is it's real usecase. Then something like UDO, solid team, low mcap and offer crypto payment solutions to users. These are why I'm invested in both project. Any other suggestions of token with all these fundamentals? This is more like a description of the QANX token from the Qanplatform which is the first quantum-resistant ETH-compatible blockchain built by teams of experts with strong professional background from companies and projects including Ethereum, Monero, zCash, Uber, IBM, Telekom. Basically investing in low cap projects can be very profitable for this reasons I look closely into any low cap with fundamental properties and specifically Polkadot low caps have proved beyond all doubts to be a solid investment, I hop on PNODE at its IDO sometime last year and making a ground breaking 2000% was a major hit and still looking to make more wins as time goes by. I can't really speak for others, but I believe RFOX fits this description in my opinion, I've been in the ecosystem for a while, and their community is solid and welcoming, with close partnership with coingecko and ICON, to name a few. And M-cap is around $55M. I think Subsquid satisfies conditions 2 to 4. Their token launch event comes up later this year. MUST is a good gem to bag. Not only does it have one of the best crypto   
and NFT gaming presenter in the name of Jerome as its CEO, it has a   
strong passion for driving and also has a good gaming platform. Catcoin would be my suggestion. It‚Äôs a 15 million MC now with an ATH MC of 70 million. It‚Äôs on a few exchanges LBank and Azbit and it‚Äôs hoping to make that jump to a tier 1 exchange. It‚Äôs community run but the admin all have previous experience with successful crypto projects. There‚Äôs a lot of tokens in circulation but with such a low market cap you buy a lot of tokens for not very much $.  The reflections are probably the best part as you earn money just simply holding Catcoin so you basically get paid to sit back and ride the wave. landshare/mybricksfinance

Whether in the form of decentralized exchanges, lending and borrowing of different asset types, or through insurance products, DeFi is evolving and expanding swiftly to mirror the traditional financial services ecosystem.

One of the most appealing aspects of adopting blockchain technology to reinvent banking is the potential for the market to become permissionless and accessible to anybody. Another appealing feature is the notion of composability, which allows anybody to combine current DeFi offerings to create a new one. The scalability of such a network, which is basically made up of blocks of interconnecting components, implies that future financial inventions and demands may be readily constructed on top of it and connected, all under the control of smart contracts.

That's how we have a Kaiba DeFi Lightning Chain (KLC) which is a fast and cheap blockchain based on PoA consensus that is 100 times faster and 1000 times cheaper than ETH. It is not only 100% compatible with ETH, but also cross-chain compatible with other major blockchains.

Especially when the market is in stagnation, and you don‚Äôt gain any substantial profit.¬†

You might have heard about crypto loans here and there, but let‚Äôs clarify everything and dot the I.

https://preview.redd.it/8gk0pdl369491.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=09b47b95cb6ea4f61c02b5bfb084ce77baccb398

**How Do Crypto Loans Work?**  
When the market is stuck and you can't earn, you probably, lock the assets until the prices increase. But if there is any other option to make your money work? Crypto loans can be a solution.¬†

A crypto loan is a form of decentralized finance that investors can use to lend their crypto assets to borrowers who are seeking investors. In return, you'll earn interest payments or so-called 'crypto dividends.'¬†

The question is, why would a borrower want to borrow funds? Let's look at the example, you have Bitcoin ($BTC), and the Bitcoin market is on the rise. So, you don't want to sell it, but instead, use your Bitcoin as collateral, borrow a stablecoin such as Tether ($USDT) pegged to the U.S. dollar, and get liquidity. When you return your loan, you get your Bitcoins back, and if their value's increased in that interval, you won.  


**When Do You Need a Crypto Loan?**¬†  
That‚Äôs a broad-spectrum of cases when you might need to use a crypto lending platform. Here are the most common:

1. **Reinvesting** ‚Äî borrow your holdings against stablecoins and spend the funds to stack more of the same currencies you have.  

2. **Short-selling** ‚Äî borrow your stablecoins against chosen assets and sell received cryptocurrencies at the current exchange rate.  

3. **Boost your passive income** ‚Äì take out a crypto loan and add the released funds to earn more passive income;  

4. **Diversify your portfolio** ‚Äî borrow your holdings against stablecoins and spend it to diversify your portfolio by adding various currencies;
5. **Daily purchases** ‚Äî borrow your holdings against stablecoins, exchange them for fiat and spend for your day-to-day needs such as rent, travelling, clothes, or services without converting your crypto to fiat.

**Cryptocurrency Loan Collateral**  
Crypto lending platforms remove intermediaries in a blockchain-based ecosystem and provide crypto loan facilities. Thus, you can‚Äôt get a crypto loan without cryptocurrency as collateral.¬†

Borrowers have to over-collateralize their debts to protect the lender‚Äôs assets. It‚Äôs used as there are no credit checks for borrowing crypto. So, if a borrower couldn‚Äôt repay the debt, the collateral will be locked. This makes it possible for people with poor to no credit history to borrow crypto.

Another way of using collateral is to calculate an individual's lending risk and terms of the loan, such as payment period, interest rate, and amount of lendable funds. The higher the collateral, the lower lenders‚Äô risk.¬†

For this, you should calculate Loan-to-Value (or LTV). LTV is the ratio of an individual‚Äôs loan value to the value of their collateral. With LTV, crypto loan providers can evaluate individual lending risk levels.¬†

**Is a Crypto Loan Risky?**  
Since there are benefits to using your digital currency to secure a loan, there are also some drawbacks, and here they are:

**Margin calls**: it happens when your collateral‚Äôs value decreases and the lender requires you to increase your holdings to manage the loan.¬†

**There isn‚Äôt access to your assets**: when your loan has an outstanding balance, you can‚Äôt access your holdings to trade or transact.¬†

**Repayment terms differ**: These loans usually function like traditional installment loans and depending on the crypto lending program, you may have less than a year to pay back what you borrowed. In other cases, you can create your own repayment schedule. With shorter repayment terms, it‚Äôs crucial that you know beforehand whether you can afford the payments.

**Limited assets:** it depends on the crypto lending platform you use, so you may need to swap your currency for an eligible asset that is supported by the platform.

**Account funds aren‚Äôt insured**: If you lend your own digital assets, the funds in a crypto interest account aren‚Äôt insured like your fiat money in the bank account.¬†

**Withdrawals can be slow**: You can request a withdrawal from your crypto interest account whenever you need it. Depending on the platform, it could take some time, though.

I don't know why I'm the only one talking about this or maybe I'm the only one bothered by this, bas Eth 2.0 going to proof-of-stake might not be the best idea.

Let's not forget this is the idea that Cardano tried to implement, and look at where they are now. Crypto is supposed to be rewarding for hard work, not for large funds. Ethereum trying to reward the highest bidder makes it as power-hungry as the next guy.

Don't get me wrong here, no one loves Ethereum more than I do, which is why I always tried to educate others on it and defend their negative aspects, such as the gas fees, and the long wait for transactions, but going to 2.0 makes it unfair for the little guy and it's time we talked about it.

Let's not forget there are thousands of people across different social tiers who are fully invested in ETH mining gear, even many here in my little country, who will be absolutely rekt when the update comes in.

There are many things that Ethereum could spend time working on, many that are dire and require urgent solutions, like the smart contracts or constant attacks on the blockchain, to which they can offer an insurance fund of sorts (?) as how Kraken exchange has done or how soIana prime has implemented, or the long wait for transaction to which they can implement some micro-mining mechanism such as with the case of lota, but instead of solving these solutions, eth will collectively be moved to a new order, and few are posing questions about why is that.

Proof of Work also rewards you for having money, mining hardware is expensive, and it discriminates against people who live in countries with expensive elecriticy and lots of electricity taxes where mining is not profitable unless you are a company and can get a special electricity contract. Staking rewards you with an interest that you can start profiting from with your small amount of money withount needing enough to buy a mining rig, staking is far more accesible than mining for a lot of people. Look where Cardano is now?  What?  PoS is inevitable and it works really well. Proof of work is a fossil at this point. Pretty harsh on the environment and literally no reason to revert back to a proof of work system. Gary Gensler has just entered the chat Exactly, eth has lost their DeFi edge, and other blockchains are taking over, it's great what Solana for example have been doing lately. You don't need to turn into a bank to provide a better experience for your users, Solana implemented an insurance fund on their launchpad SoIprime which is an example of how its done. PoS is a good choice by Ethereum but I think PoR that was developed by QAN is intriguing. You don't need much money for that you only need to have a phone and purchase tickets, validators are picked at random to validate nodes, this way it eliminates the chances of the ones with more money making the most out of it. I always wanted to stake and I do that cause passive income is a very good strategy for a person to improve one's portfolio and income. Recently I staked UDO and started earning 0.35% on UDO tokens on daily basis. It's a temporary program and it does not offer POS or anything but still why should I let go of it. For me, it doesn't matter if the project is offering PoW or PoS all I want to know is the project is legit or a rug.

12,Best Upcoming Metaverse Projects (That aren't Facebook!),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/sk0j9g/best_upcoming_metaverse_projects_that_arent/,"""
 
Here's a list of some of the most promising Metaverse projects out there. Some you may be familiar with, while others may be newer projects that are currently flying under the radar... I'd love to hear about any other hotly tipped projects that people are excited about. Obviously, none of this is financial advice; rather, it is a reflection on some ongoing and upcoming projects that have been gaining traction.

1.	2.26 billion mcap Decentraland (MANA) - Binance - Coinbase - Huobi Obviously, most of you are already aware of this. The most well-known blockchain-based virtual reality world has been rallying as a result of recent attention and appears to be on track to surpass its previous high. The Ethereum Blockchain powers Decentraland, a community-driven Metaverse. Users can use its Builder Tool or SDK (developer toolkit), which are designed to create virtual environments and applications, to create, experience, and monetize content.

2.	Bloktopia (BLOK) - 
-Constructed with Polygon. There were some early doubts about its legitimacy, but with names like Elrond and Avax establishing virtual headquarters in this metaverse, they are already attracting a large number of reputable names to the project. Earn cryptocurrency by participating in games and daily competitions, as well as using the builder tools to create your own areas. This one is looking to challenge the likes of Sandbox and Decentraland as the next place to hang out in the VR world, with all the usual metaverse goodness. Keep in mind that the game hasn't been released yet!


3.	Metakawn 
They want to create the first Halal Metaverse for Generation M, where everyone shares the same values. They also want to bridge the gap between Muslim* creatives/content creators and their fans (in fields such as fashion, sports, health, religion, education, art and design, music, family, etc.). A platform that allows Muslim creators to be paid fairly and directly by their community rather than relying on brand sponsorship and/or social media platforms (Youtube, etc.).

I mean yes, you can invest millions in a project that sounds like the next big thing, but what if developers fail to deliver what they‚Äôve promised, because you can never be 100% sure about the outcome and performance of a startup. 

Which is why i personally invest in projects like BitDAO that‚Äôs using its community owned treasury to invest in innovative Web3 projects, and not wasting the money on projects with no long term utilities.

12,"Today, individuals have a million reasons to break away from the classic banking system, yet not all of us are willing to break free. Why is that happening?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/rja1vp/today_individuals_have_a_million_reasons_to_break/,"I‚Äôve been investing in cryptocurrency for almost 3 years now, and I‚Äôve seen this market pumping and dumping many times. But I cannot deny that 2021 was one of the best years for cryptocurrency as a whole. The market saw some real huge appreciation in terms of numbers, whether we‚Äôre speaking about prices or number of investors.

But one thing that keeps on triggering me is the fact that people still believe that banks are the best ‚Äúplace‚Äù to hold our money. No they‚Äôre not. We‚Äôve been ruled by these greedy bankers for good long years, and now it‚Äôs the perfect time for us to break free. But why do some people still believe their money is safe in a bank account? In my country, banks literally put their hands on the people‚Äôs money. Now they‚Äôre literally controlling individual‚Äôs capitals and not allowing anyone to withdraw their money.

However, crypto and decentralized finance aka DeFi are giving individuals the chance for an alternative investment. I mean I don‚Äôt blame my parents for investing their money in the banks since they had no other options, but I‚Äôm sure my children and grand children won‚Äôt be so proud if we keep on holding our money with those greedy institutions. 

Now it‚Äôs the perfect time to invest in DeFi in my opinion, for this is the time when all those DeFi platforms are seeking validation and trying to satisfy their investors. I recently invested in BitDAO, the largest crypto treasury. What I like about DAOs is the governance power, where all investors get the chance to vote on the decisions to be made. In this case, as a BIT holder I‚Äôm getting the chance to vote on upcoming DeFi projects. This is actually something that no classic financial institution can present.

I really believe 2022 will be a decent year for crypto. Hopefully, people will get to the point to understand that we are the ones who have the authority, and not the banks neither their sister companies which are making billions on our account.",4,36,False," Most places don't accept crypto. It's also (for the most part) uninsured, unlike FDIC backed bank accounts. It's also almost completely unregulated.

It's a bit silly to ask this simply because it's still so early as far as adoption goes. We're just getting to the point that a decent portion of society even knows what crypto is, let alone ask them to disrupt their entire financial system over it. It's a simple answer, how I view it. About the whole thing with banks. People need a place to put their money. Banks offer protection if it gets stolen. There's many laws in place incase something happens to the bank especially living in America. Someone steals a Visa card and spends your money, you can file to get that back. Until crypto is more widely adopted as a form of payment the big banks will continue to be used. Sadly you can't go to the gas station and pay using crypto. I can't use a token or coin to pay my cell phone bill or car payment. If bank loses your money they will have to pay it back . Crypto has no insurance policy No proper education on it. The only people truly in the fore front of promoting crypto are the exchanges. Which to those unfamiliar just seem like cash grabs. Plus crypto is a really hard thing to grasp if you are not simplifying the point. Not everyone is going to give a good in depth search into understanding it. But education is the main thing, with the biggest banks with millions of customers tells the world cryptos a waste of time, there‚Äôs enough people there to convince that it‚Äôs not a good idea. Until it‚Äôs properly utilised with main stream government and communities will it ever be properly adopted. At the moment it‚Äôs a great investment for your money. We need a solid, very trustworthy, completely decentralised stablecoin not based on fiat.

Not sure if that is possible. Defi got hacked?
Sent funds to wrong address?
Sent funds using wrong standard?

Who you gonna call? No one :) Because crypto is still primarily valued in fiat, there's no regulations to bring clarity to businesses on how to deal with crypto transactions, and there are no protections to stop anyone from creating new coins or rug pulling after. The world will be in chaos if we all ditched fiat for crypto right now. The concept of DeFi needs more adoption. But a good bullish thing is actually that even Institutional investors show interest to join. EQIBank is about to use UnidoEP institutional platfrom for staking and DeFi access. More adoption is around the corner. Too early plus humans don‚Äôt like change. Change is bad to them. They can‚Äôt handle or think it through if it takes more time than a CNN news break.

12,Web3 Public Relations: What you need to know,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/suqxkr/web3_public_relations_what_you_need_to_know/,"Since Web3 is overgrowing, I thought it might be helpful to share some insights for Web3 companies about the right way to run a public relations campaign.

For those of you who know familiar, Public Relations according to Wikipedia:

Public relations is the practice of managing and disseminating information from an individual or an organization to the public to affect their public perception. 

In the blockchain industry, PR is done differently than in other sectors. There are many reasons, but the main one is probably since in 2017-2018, when the [ICO bubble burst](https://elementus.io/blog/ico-market-august-2018/), many investors lost their money to scam projects, harming the whole industry's reputation. Investors became more educated and more suspicious about any crypto-related project.

I've summarized into bullet points what you need to know about Web3 PR:

- **Solid design & Brand Identity: **Some companies try to run so fast with their fundraising and token that they forget to clear and visible their core idea. Make sure your company is ready for PR before launching and campaign. If you invest thousands of dollars on PR and then a potential investor gets to your site and is not impressed by the design or doesn't remember your company name after they left the site, that's a waste of money and PR. 

- **Budget:** A bit of context- When it comes to blockchain, everything costs x4 than other industries. It's mainly since, for years, giant tech companies banned crypto ads. This action gave A LOT of power to crypto news sites. Projects didn't have a choice but to spend their money mainly on PR. With limited channels available, crypto news sites raised their prices. When the market crashed, the prices remained pretty much the same. Web3 PR campaigns usually begin at $15,000. When it comes to PR, there is no spending limit. You can always pay more to get featured in more places. You need to find the right balance between making buzz to keep it going for the long run. Many companies just launch a massive campaign for 2-3 months and then disappear. I find it absurd. PR should be one of your monthly expenses if your company is here to stay. It helps new investors and users hear about it. PR should also fuel your [SEO](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo/why-search-engine-marketing-is-necessary) efforts. You can learn more about PR in this dedicated guide: [Blockchain PR- All you need to know ](https://guerrillabuzz.com/blockchain-pr/)

- **Reachable:** When I read about a certain company on TechCrunch or any other tech news site, i usually check their Linkedin & their CEO profile by default. In the crypto industry, that's the same. Many investors prefer to invest in projects to see the project's Linkedin/Github/ channels and see the team profiles. Do you want to get high-quality investors? Make sure your team is reachable. It will potentially attract more investors to your project and improve your brand authority. (Cool[ thread in the Cardano subreddit ](https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/d9lxfl/emurgo_how_to_use_github_and_other_tools_to/)about how to analyze project potential from their Github page)",9,11,False," This was helpful to broaden my horizon . There is more to know about web3 including the area of decentralized communication , the area of privacy , the area of security and many more of which Sylo tends to offer. It's sad the PR in crypto sucks, nowaday it's all about the rockets and hype 

The only ones that do PR for anything useful are very small projects that actually want to build something like AlgoFi and Kaddex but theyre rarely heard

It's always like this in new markets though, speculators pop bubbles then the quality stuff comes, i feel like the next bubble that will be inflating are Dex Coins tho, so be careful when they suddenly skyrocket

Bob eco coin is one such project to anticipate, as it has social and cultural implications in African communities by providing education programmes, assisting the environment through the use of electric vehicles, and providing clean water to those in need, as well as creating jobs.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**:

Dubbed the Google of blockchain, The Graph is really contributing to a revolutionary change as they solve the problems of data. With their solution, data on blockchain will be more systematic, easy to query and bring convenience to users.

The Graph is supporting multi-blockchain scaling, testing subgraphs on the framework, optimizing Blockchain L1, developing programs with educational content and much more in the future.

# General Conclusion

The Graph is seen as the Google of crypto, helping users to query information similar to how we often do in real life. In this article we will learn about three main parts:

* What is The Graph, what is the idea and product of the project?
* The relevant information about the main token of the project which is $GRT.
* Finally, we will combine the above factors to provide an overview of the robustness of the $GRT economics model.

# What Problem Does The Graph Solve?

From the user's perspective, they almost don't care much about whether the application is decentralised or centralised. What they really care about is which one is smoother, faster and cheaper.

If the app doesn't meet this, it will gradually be eliminated by other protocols that do better. One of the main problems is accessing data directly from blockchains.

Data output from the blockchain is rarely stored in a format that can be used directly in dapps (decentralised applications). It needs sorting, sorting, and reprocessing so that dapps can process more easily and smoothly.

Looking at how it works, it can be said that Graph is solving a huge problem of data provided for dapp applications on the Web 3.0 platform. The Graph can be considered as a gateway to enter Web3.

 

# What Is The Graph's Solution?

The Graph's solution is to build a protocol that anyone can access to build and publish APIs called subgraphs. Subgraphs makes it easier to access data from blockchain.

All data is encrypted, stored and processed on-chain with verifiable integrity. Through its API, The Graph makes querying these data fast, reliable and secure.",1,12,False,,0.0

It sort of depends how you want to interact with crypto  


Are you more of an investor?   
\- if you prefer to research the fundamentals of different crypto projects out there, check white papers, partners, community pages etc   
\- learn some basic technical analysis. ie resistance, support, fibs, trend, basic risk management. The basics are on youtube. Highly recommend Rayner Teo's videos despite being forex focused.    
\- learn to dollar cost average and take some profit here and there  
\- compound profits  


are you wanting to be a trader?  
\- deep dive into technical analysis and price action  
\- find a strategy that works for you, your personality and your how much time you have to trade.   
\- stick to Bitcoin and eth to start with and then branch out into major alt coins  
\- learn how market cycles work  
\- find a good basics course where you can interact with other traders  
\- dont be afraid to lose some money along the way  


There are so many ways to interact with crypto and everyone has there own thing. You could learn to yield farm or flip nft's, develop your own protocol etc. As for more professional things there are courses on blockchain and computer science through a lot of universities and online now days but it depends what you're trying to achieve with crypto.   


good luck :) Buy high, sell low...listen to everyone on crypto Reddit‚Äôs.  Prepare to loose 50% before you make 1000%.  Dogs bite hard! Here you go:

https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html Check out A16z podcast. Plenty of episodes on crypto. You came to a bad sub to start. Here many people will try to shove risky and often scammy altcoin projects down your throat.

And you are not late. You know what everybody was sure about when I joined 2017? That they are late. Dca 60 40 btc and eth and spend 30 minutes a day doing some type of research. If something sounds too good to be true search for counter points, if you can't figure out if its legit or not avoid it all together.

For each person a plan could be different and you must have a plan for each scenario because when shit hits the fan and you only see red, you will most likely end up on the losing side.

Another recommendation is following plan B on Twitter or the website; he has the most reliable on chain and technical BTC indicators (although if you don't know a lot about technical analysis you may get s bit lost). On chain metrics are the most important metric in BTC, but that's maybe a bit more advanced, although it's the most accurate way to predict the future price movement of BTC.

Economics like to assume that people are rational. Yet, humans are the most irrational being in the world. We have so many biases, assumptions and we are influenced so easily.Remember in EP 3, I mentioned that digital economics is a closed loop system. In this closed loop system, we get to engineer incentives towards the targeted desired outcome.How do we do this? Through behavioural economics. And this is the first underlying principle to manage an ecosystem. It takes into consideration the irrationality of people's behaviour.In this episode, we will dive into

1. What behavioural economics is
2. Why are we like that? Why are we so prone to influence?
3. How can we apply behavioural economics applied to token economics?

What is Behavioural EconomicsBehavioural economics is a specific field of economics research. It studies the effects of social norms and individual psychology on economics decisions. In classical economics, we assume that everyone is logical. In behavioural economics, we study why people are illogical and why they behave like that.For example, buying a 2 weeks worth of food during a pandemic is logical. But buying endless rolls of toilet paper?Some possible answers:‚ÄúThe thing about panic-buying is that it gives us a sense of control at a time when we‚Äôre lacking that,‚Äù says Deborah Small, a psychologist who studies consumer judgment and human decision-making at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Wharton School of Business. She adds that things get harried when ‚Äúpeople hear that other people are buying something, and they say, ‚ÄòOh, I need that too.‚Äô And it just spirals to this level where we have none.‚Äù

* People compare and when everyone is doing it, they are more likely to do it too. It's the herd mentality.
* Some people don't know what they want until they see it in context. Everything is relative, and if there is relatively less toilet paper than say noodles and rice, the irrational side is more interested in toilet paper.
* To make people desire things, making that thing difficult to attain reduces the logical side. Toilet papers were literally out of stock, and attaining it is very difficult.

## 3 Themes

There are 3 themes to behavioural economics, heuristics, framing and market inefficiencies.**Heuristics**In Daniel Kahneman's book, thinking fast and slow, he introduced 2 thinking systems in our head. System 1 thinks fast. System 2 thinks slow. Humans are not only illogical, but we are also super lazy. You would rather watch more mindless Netflix than solve a very difficult mathematics problem.That's not all your fault, really. Our brains are lazy and we like to take shortcuts. We like to take the path of least resistance. We like the easy way. That's where System 1 comes in. System 1 learns from experience and it becomes a mental shortcut. Or a rule of thumb. You know how you can customise commands on Siri or Alexa? Same thing. Our brain does that. So we can conserve our energy when we need to think more.That's good right? Yeah, but no. We make 95% of our decisions with this shortcut tool, and the decisions does not consider other new information that is available.**Framing**The world is a very complicated place. Things are difficult to understand. How does internet work? How does emails work? What the hell is bitcoin? Why is the government doing what it is doing?Well, this is why we have anecdotes, stories and stereotypes. It is easier to understand complicated things when it is simplified. They also become a mental filter for us to rely on understanding.Think of Instagram filters. It is a set of fixed filters that is applied to our faces. But it doesn't always work! Sometimes, we end up with strange glitches. Our brains, being lazy, apply these filters. Sometimes, glitch happens. And we make illogical decisions.**Market Inefficiencies**So what about heuristics and framing? Ultimately, it creates market inefficiencies. What are market inefficiencies? Pricing things wrongly, making illogical decisions, etc.

## Why Study Behavioural Economics?

With economics, we like to predict things so we can make the best decisions. With classical economics, we assume that people are rational. Turns out, they are not. So with behavioural economics, we can predict people's irrationality that defy economic theory.

>Basically, we can predict better now.

How? There are a few ways, but a major way is called Prospect Theory. We evaluate options based on alternatives.Let's say I tell you that I will give you 100 followers on your LinkedIn. The value of that 100 followers depends on how many followers you currently have. 100 is the absolutely value. But 100 can be a lot psychologically, depending on the reference point. For someone with 500 followers, and it is nothing for someone with 10,000 followers. We also experience different sensitivity to the changes in followers. Adding 100 when you start with 500 feels better than adding 100 when you start with 10,000 followers. And we do love having more followers, who value and appreciate the work we do!If you don't remember anything, just remember that decisions are reference dependence. We need references to evaluate outcomes. And people don't evaluate options equally. It depends on the changes, relative to the reference point in absolute value. People are happier when the difference is smaller than when the difference is too huge.For example, 100 followers added to an account with 500 followers vs 10,000 followers.

# Why are we like that? Why are we so prone to influence?

We have two levels of thinking. We have our rational mind that tells us, ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt need to buy another roll of toilet paper.‚Äù But we also have a more primitive, visceral, gut reaction that says, ‚ÄúWell, I better be safe than sorry. There will be no more toilet paper anymore.‚ÄùThe herd instinct can also kick in, where people suspend judgement and start doing what everyone else is doing. So, if everyone else is panic-buying supplies, people follow the herd.Heuristics influence our choices which are irrational and counter intuitive; we need help making better choices.We are prone to influence in 6 ways:

1. **Reciprocation:** when someone does a favour for you, you are more likely to return the favour some day. For example, in crisis like this, China sends their doctors to Italy to help with the pandemic. I am certain this act will be reciprocated by Italy to China some day down the future.
2. **Social Proof/Consensus:** If you are in the blockchain space, are you sick of the word consensus? Consensus just means something the mass agrees to. It is also a form of social proof, because if everyone agrees to it, it is likely to be right. For example, if the WHO and government of major countries think that the virus requires a lockdown and pause on the economy, other countries are likely to follow suite and agree that it is the right course of action. I'm not saying it is irrational to do so, I'm just saying we can be easily influenced by the action that most people agree to do.
3. **Authority**: I notice this early on in my life. I've been to many events and conferences, where just because the speaker is an older caucasian dude talking about things, people just believe him. And when I stand up to correct the information, it always starts with looks of ""who you think you are, young asian female."" But when coherent points and arguments are made, the audience starts to view me with more authority. We think with our fast thinking brain, called System 1. And we apply stereotypes that we previously had. It's fine though, I think, as long as one is open to changes and be aware of the fast thinking that we have.
4. **Liking**: Believe or not, people like beautiful looking people and people that are similar to us. Model \*\*\*\*selling us something will influence us to purchase it more than some random ugly person on the street. We also like people who are similar to us, because familiarity is something we all love. That's why nostalgia sells. We end up getting influenced easily this way.
5. **Scarcity**: We simply want something more just because we can't have it. Why is Bitcoin so sought after? There will only be 21M Bitcoin in existence. Is there a real purpose for Bitcoin other than being a digital asset for investment? Maybe. Who knows. We are influenced and so captivated by the idea of scarcity, and that you can own something that someone else doesn't have. Who is the best example of this? Supreme and everything that Supreme sells. They sell scarcity. And people are influenced to pay $100 for a brick.
6. **Commitment & Consistency**: Lastly, consistency and commitment. We are more influenced by someone consistent in their message. For example, Bernie Sanders and his message during his lifetime career of being a politician. Or commitment by Sanders as he campaigns the same message all the time. We are more influenced by people who are committed and consistent.

None of these make logical sense, but hey, we are not always logical, right.

# How can we apply behavioural economics applied to token economics?

Firstly, it fits into Layer 2 of the economics design framework.Layer 1 is the system architecture. That is the nerdy things and coded in algorithms or hard coded in the system. The framework is available as a research paper.Layer 1 is limited, because it is based on classical economics and assumes rationality of people. We've already learnt that that fails. So we need Layer 2.Layer 2 is a game design that embeds behavioural economics into the experience. Think of user experience plus gamification.

## Gamified Systems

We can increase the probability of people's irrational actions through design. For example, I have 3 options:A: fruit basket for $15B: candy bars for $10C: fruit basket and candy bars for $15What would you get? Most probably option C.People rarely choose things in absolutely terms. We simply don't have an internal value meter for what things are worth. It is easier when the item is being compared, to get its internal value.**Example: exchange tokens.**Exchange tokens gather its value when traders get to pay in fiat, crypto or the native exchange tokens. When they get a better deal with the exchange tokens, they are more likely to want to get the tokens, instead of selling it in the secondary market. E.g. BNB token

## Nudge Theory

Nudge is a concept which proposes positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions as ways to influence the behavior and decision making of groups or individuals. Basically, influencing people's ""independent"" actions towards the behaviour you want.It's kind of like Pavlov and his dogs. Ring the bell and the dog salivate. But it is more than just that. An example is Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport attaching an image of a housefly into the men's room urinals. Men would pee to aim at the housefly and cleanliness of the urinal went up. I guess men are not good at peeing.**Example: deflationary token**A simple example is deflationary tokens. Tokens have limited supply, and when demand soars, the price of tokens will increase. How can we nudge the demand? By reducing supply available like staking to be a validator or staking to earn interest on stakes. The behaviour you want is to reduce available supply, so as to increase prices. So you can influence the behaviour by having a better trade-off: earning interest on tokens staked.

## 6 Influence Methods

1. **Reciprocation:** By adding value first, before extracting value. For example, Crypto. com provides value-add like free netflix, free amazon prime and free spotify when you sign up with their cards.
2. **Social Proof/Consensus:** The simplest example would be Augur, the online betting platform. But that **is** their business model, so it doesn't count. Why is Bitcoin so valuable? Almost all crypto-people I know have assets in Bitcoin. The social proof is strong. When prices of Bitcoin fell on 16 Mar 2020, instead of liquidating more, social media was asking everyone to purchase more, since prices were so low. That consensus brought prices of BTC up again in 24h.
3. **Authority**: Authority comes from the background of the founders, their experience, educational background and street cred in the space. This is most evident in blockchain projects by academic professors like Silvio Micali, who founded Algorand.
4. **Liking**: I still find this funny, but in Asia, you see companies hiring pretty females to model for their crypto-projects. And according to plenty of my male friends in the space, these girls do a great job at influencing males to sign up for their projects.
5. **Scarcity**: We simply want something more just because we can't have it. Following Bitcoin's path of limited supply, every other project has a capped supply of tokens to induce scarcity.
6. **Commitment & Consistency**: When Bitcoin's price fell on 16 Mar, the community was selling bitcoin hard on twitter and reddit. It's interesting because these people have quite some BTC in their portfolio, and they need to pump up the prices and continue the faith that BTC is worth something. Whatever it is, they are consistent in their message and truly committed in their shilling.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, many design of these crypto systems fail even with beautiful mathematical formula is that they miss out behavioral economics.Economics design of the crypto ecosystems are in 2 layers.Layer 1 is the system architecture. That is the nerdy things and coded in algorithms or hard coded in the system. For example, matching algorithms, resolution mechanisms and monetary policy.Layer 2 is a game design that embeds behavioural economics into the experience. That is user psychology plus gamification.If designing an ecosystem is like making creme br√ªl√©e, behavioural economics is using the blowtorch to caramalise the sugar to light golden brown. It's a very crucial and important step!

# 3 Discussion Takeaways Worth Pondering

1. Do you think designers need to abide by some regulations to ensure the morality of how systems are designed? It could go out of hand to influence people's decisions. This is evident in the countless of scams around.
2. Isn‚Äôt behavioral economics a depressing view of human nature?
3. How can we use good design for good purposes? For example, using nudge theory to encourage good behaviours. We collect data of someone's health status, and reward them with tokens when they attain certain healthy metrics. That's a positive use of nudge theory.",0,1,False,,0.0
12,Avoiding ICO Scams.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/s5hztd/avoiding_ico_scams/,"""It is no longer news that ICO‚Äôs are susceptible to fraudsters. This is generally because almost anybody can lunch an ICO. To stand a chance of unearthing the fraudulent nature of an ICO requires significant due diligence.
 However, this is no easy task as fraudulent ICO teams have upped the ante and these days have become more difficult to spot.
 In recent times they have even partnered with celebrities and influencers to give them good PR and pseudo legitimacy.
 But what if there was a way of guaranteeing you don‚Äôt lose your hard-earned money to fraudulent ICOs? 
 I present to you Escrow ICO funding.
 As the name implies, in Escrow ICO funding, funds are held in escrow and released upon successful achievement of agreed milestones. Start-up projects seeking funding through ICO‚Äôs can lay out a roadmap of milestones and timelines to achieve these milestones in accordance with their actual capacity to do so, thus, establishing measurable criteria for delivering payments upon only fulfillable promises. 

At this point, you are probably wondering which Escrow platform is best for me. In my opinion, the Escrow Protocol platform stands out for me. This is because beyond the holding funds in escrow and the amazing prospect of making a profit on your invested funds via staking, the platform has firm plans in place to expand its services to offer a full investment education package, drawn from expert research and bolstered by the experience and knowledge gathered as the platform scales up and matures. Ultimately, the decision of whether to invest or not lies squarely with the investor himself or herself. But what this does in my opinion is both educate and empower the investors. 
In conclusion, Escrow is the way to avoid ICO scams and if an ICO has no escrow arrangement, please do yourself a favor and run far away from it.""",8,15,False,,0.0

Crypto Ponzi Schemes: Ponzi scams generally trick victims into investing in a n essentially a nonexistent project. 
Fake apps and exchanges: another way that investors get scammed is developing fake apps and non-existent exchanges. When these apps are downloaded they give the scammers access to the victims private data like funicular information. 
Pump and dump schemes: Here, scammers encourage investors to buy crypto assets in dubious crypto projects, based on false information. The price of the cryptocurrency subsequently rises and the scammer sells his own shares, earning a handsome profit and leaving the victim with worthless coins.
Fake celebrity endorsements: in this scam, celebrity social media handles are hacked or faked. The scammers the use these accounts to post good reviews about fake crypto currencies.

**TLDR**:

What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves. Education, off-chain integration, as well as governance, are the three biggest keys to unlocking how we are going to make this renaissance truly impactful. It is not just protesting on the streets or arguing with people on Twitter. These are tangible things that we can do right now to make a very big significant difference in the future.

# What Has History Taught Us?

One way to look at history is as a pendulum swinging back and forth between aggregation and decentralisation.

Throughout the Middle Ages you had power and wealth and economic value was becoming increasingly concentrated century after century. A part of this was aggregated in the Roman Catholic Church but it wasn't just religious and they actually acted as a political entity. The way we can best view ourselves is almost as medieval European farmers. Our world is fundamentally aggregated and pulled together and we exist in this world of hierarchy.

During the Middle Ages what happened was that communities tried to coordinate socially and resist this hierarchy and create more free economic markets and exchange information more freely with one another but they could never really pull it off. They were at the bottom of not just the religious pyramid but this political pyramid and each time they tried to do anything they were smashed by those in power at the top of the pyramid. They could not coordinate and communicate ideas effectively with one another nor could they incentivise one another economically and could not share value very efficiently.

What happened at least last time throughout the 14th and 15th and then into the 16th century is what they call the renaissance which is just a fancy word for rebirth. It was a rebirth of not just their economic system or their political system but actually their culture and their identity of how they thought about themselves. The other attempts at renaissance and reformation were smashed each time because they didn't have the decentralised technology to be able to effectively coordinate and build markets and take action. There were two particular new types of technology that allowed this renaissance to actually work last time ‚Äî the printing press and double-entry bookkeeping i.e. a ledger.

## Ledger

Ledger was absolutely radical at that point in time. Credit and debit and left and right was something new. Medici had rediscovered it from back in the Roman Era. Some of the people talked about it and it was used in North African communities. It was like magic where all of a sudden, the power brokers didn't have absolute control over the monetary system. You could essentially prevent false forks, increase velocity and composability. As a result, there was an explosion of financial technology around this idea of using ledger-based accounting and reconciliation system for contracts. It gave an increasing amount of people access to capital and created a whole proto-capitalistic or proto-economic class.

## Printing Press

When we think printing press we think of machines or newspapers or somebody cranking out a Gutenberg bible but most of what was printed was actually images with big words and tag lines. They were almost like the memes of the day. It allowed you to share ideas at scale where previously if you wanted to share a document like an economic contract or piece of literature it would cost you a year's or 10-year‚Äôs salary to have a¬†scribe make the copy. It was locked away under permission and observability. Being at the bottom of the pyramid probably meant you would not even have rights to access that contract. The printing press allowed the dissemination of ideas at scale and also the openness of these contracts to a lesser degree.

The technology was fundamentally distributed and decentralised. The power structures did not like it obviously because they had controlled the means of not just economic coordination but also information. They tried to outlaw it but that did not really work very well because it was decentralised in the sense that it only took a couple of hours in a shop off-grid. They tried to KYC it and register printers which didn't work either. They were placed in this no-win situation where the technology was growing so fast and the audience was growing so rapidly that they either had to engage in this battle back and forth or they could ignore it and so they ended up engaging it and so the printing press actually created its own market.

Only like five percent of people were literate at that time. You could not afford or have access to a handwritten document and it went from being a year's salary or 10-year's salary to being the cost of a chicken, essentially. Many families could then access these new radical ideas and these radical ideas created a market which created literacy as folks gained more and more access.

# How Can Tokens Coordinate Market Creation?

Society is good at small micro skill coordination where people are physically near each other like small little villages but when we start transacting across the internet or across jurisdictions or across geographical locations then it becomes very hard to coordinate. This is where the power of tokens can really come in because a market is basically just this common ground where a buyer and seller come together to trade and transact, which is coordination. The difficult part is to figure out how we get everyone to come to this common place to trade and how do we use this technology or this platform. This is one of the biggest benefits that tokens can bring, which is a tool for incentivisation.

People only do things because they are incentivised to do so. Adam Smith once said that the butcher in the shop does not cut meat because he is worried that you do not have anything to eat. The butcher is incentivised to do that because he is paid to do so. People behave in response to incentives and we need more coordination to create markets for people to trade. This is where the network is formed and the value is formed and we can use tokens to promote that coordination.

In the previous world, you had to trade through centralised aggregation. There were maybe like four markets a year and only in select locations so if you wanted to sell your goods you had to go to that place at that time and there were only these limited windows. This was essentially because the markets were dictated from on high. They were allowed (granted permission) and the people who controlled the coin said we are going to set up shop here and we are going to not only take a piece of it in the market but also going to tell you when you can transact with anyone else. This setup limited the amount of money that flowed through a market as well as a person‚Äôs connection with someone else.

What happened with the advent of ledger-based accounting was that it broke those markets apart, so, basically, decentralisation happened. Our token is essentially an updated form of that sort of double-entry bookkeeping that allowed us to transact as a market in a decentralised way. It means we can do it more than four times a year and we can do it more than just at certain appointed places so it allows the markets to become local and to become super small.

We can have a transaction not only without a mediator but at our time, at our pace, and on our own terms around a contract that introduces greater degrees of freedom into a market with much greater access in terms of time as well as space geographically, and that has massive benefits to markets

# Crypto Success: How Can Everyone Get Access To It?

What happened historically was that you had a few haves and everybody else was have-nots. Then when the technology arrived there was a rise in the middle class. We are now in a different situation where we have this aggregation but also have kind of this lump here and so we are going to have the opposite and instead of everybody moving towards the middle there will be a pulling apart. We are already starting to see that because part of technology like AI taking people's jobs. Crypto is different than just the replacement of economic inputs ‚Äî it literally gives us the opportunity to become new artisans and capitalists.

## Education

There is usually an adoption curve, and the first piece is education. We need to be doing more education and not just foundation and protocols but also about core economic concepts like how do you improve your life and your situation.

## Adoption

Part of crypto's success will be in its adoption and by that I mean: does crypto become the new rails for banks or better blockchain technology for IBM and Amazon, or does it live up to the promise of social coordination of community? It is going to be a foot race to adoption which does not necessarily mean just pure economic token design or DeFi, but actually crypto intruding into the real world and acting as an economic battery to power real-world businesses.

We are starting to see that now with NFTs and art. If you look really carefully you will find places where crypto is moving into the real world to drive adoption like play to earn, but also these little things like Helium which is an example of a little box and a broadcast internet of things and now it is also starting to do 5G. If you are a small business owner or restaurant owner, you can run this box and if you are early in your space then you are earning five, six, or even seven figures so literally by running this box and an IOS app you have already paid value into your space and your rent and now you are broadcasting it.

### Current State

Right now DeFi is awesome, but if global stocks are 200 trillion dollars and global bonds are 200 trillion dollars and crypto is 2 trillion dollars then it is just a little tiny piece of it. But if I can actually have on-chain rights for those assets like insurance or options or things in the real world then I would start sucking the real world into crypto and that will allow me to interact and grow.

### The Future

The future adoption of crypto includes a circle of people coding python or solidity and then there is another circle figuring out DeFi and token design and economics. Then there is this broader circle of people who do not care about any of it but want to use it as an economic battery to support their business in real life, and then there is a broader circle still about education.

The interesting thing about crypto is that it is just so fundamentally antithetical and inside out from AI. Crypto is inside out and upside down and it gives asymmetric advantage to the little person on the long tail instead of at the centre. From that perspective, crypto literally allows these opportunities by removing mediated places so we can create markets and express value for things that do not work within an aggregated system. All of a sudden esoteric knowledge becomes valuable like I might be a teenage mutant ninja turtles collector and I can use Upshot on NFTs. Crypto provides this opportunity for everyone but the question is: is there going to be a re-emergence of neo banks or is it going to be everyone having access to crypto? If it succeeds in everyone having access then it will have been through education and real-world intrusion and adoption which is just starting to happen.

# Value Creation

Value creation has shifted from the religion of ""money is everything"" to ""as soon as you provide value and someone accepts that value, then you are valuable"". This is the new world's UBI. UBI is not just about money but about the resources or the energy required to run a node so that you can use it to create different kinds of tools that can be given to other people. This is real value creation because why would I want to put trust in a government that is just printing money and inflating it when I myself can create that value and it can be shared!

## Is It Inevitable For Us To Recreate The Middle Layer As There Is A Proliferation Of These Apps?

If we look at human productivity as a linear line then we have very unproductive people and very productive people. Machines are coming in to take over that middle layer and then we will start to define what the new middle layer will be, which is integration between machines and humans. We are segregating this line into more segments, and you have different kinds of middle layers being formed so you have small little boutiques catering to very specific sub-segments of people. A feature of this is that one is able to solve specific needs by this specific segment of people in this timeline.

# Micro Token Economies As Nation-States

When we create these little micro-economies we are basically recreating how nation-states work ‚Äî the legal structure, the social contracts, and the legal contracts in NFTs. We are talking about citizen rights, on-chain rights, and reputation engine.

## Imagined Communities

The way you can look at imagined communities is you look at this thing called the social utility function or social optimisation function. As a society we are optimising one main thing at a time and it could be anything. It is very easy to go in and out of the system and I come into this system because I agree with the ideology and philosophy. I buy into the token because I want to be part of the governance to keep growing this.

# Conclusion

One of the biggest problems with the world today is that we are born in different countries and it is basically a lottery where you are born. It is not fair to someone who is born in Yemen in a crisis period because he or she could be exactly like someone in America but will have way lesser opportunities. However, with technology we can level up the playing field. We can start creating social communities based on common ideologies. You can even have communism or socialism or democracy or whatever political social government systems you want and then you just allow the market to dictate how the communities grow. We can then stop fighting about what social system works as the market will tell us if a social system fails, because no one will be there anymore and no one will want to govern which means no one sees a future in that system ‚Äî then there is no point arguing. It is the best experiment ever.

Education, off-chain integration, as well as governance, are the three biggest keys to unlocking how we are going to make this truly impactful. It is not just protesting on the streets or arguing with people on Twitter. These are tangible things that we can do right now to make a very big significant difference in the future.",1,13,False," PlayToEarn Games are Future in Gaming!!

Since Navcoin‚Äôs inception in 2014, we‚Äôve strived towards always being on the verge of the cryptocurrency industry. The many advances in the development of our Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, our decentralized governance model and our privacy-preserving technologies have put us in a privileged technical position compared to other players in the market.

The previous years of the market‚Äôs downtrend have been tough. Early on we had to make a decision to dedicate most of our limited resources to creating a solid technological base from which we could construct the best value transfer system possible for our community. Keeping in mind all our technological achievements in this period, we believe that we made the right decision. Among other things, our efforts have led to the integration of OpenAlias, cold-staking, a decentralised community fund, a DAO system and the soon to be released privacy protocol, blsCT/xNAV.

While we are immensely proud of our technical achievements, we acknowledge that technical development is not the only factor to consider, when trying to assert Navcoin to reach greater adoption. Thus we have decided to start dedicating some of our resources to have our message reach a wider audience. Creating quality content, educating our potential future users about the most compelling features of Navcoin and expanding its message as broad as possible will be some of our most important tasks to focus on these next months.

To achieve this goal, we are very happy to announce our marketing partership with [DAO Maker](http://daomaker.com/). [DAO Maker](http://daomaker.com/) is a technology consultancy company that works with leading innovators in the blockchain industry to undertake their most critical challenges for capturing their highest-value opportunities. They are pioneers and leaders in strategy consultancy for tokenized products‚Äô branding, business development, and growth since 2017.

[DAO Maker](http://daomaker.com/) offers various services to their clients, including Social Mining technology, omnipresent exposure methodology, and BizDev services. Their team delivered successful and lasting results to all clients from various blockchain sectors. Thanks to that, they‚Äôve had established an extensive network of wallets, blockchain projects, staking providers, payment processors, and exchanges.

We are really excited about what this partnership will bring to Navcoin and we both expect to see exponential growth derived from it.

12,Could Crypto exchanges be a hindrance to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/s8u5va/could_crypto_exchanges_be_a_hindrance_to_the_mass/," 

**To achieve mass adoption of cryptocurrency, we need to make it possible to buy everyday items with cryptocurrencies.**

But how is that ever going to happen if we keep relying on crypto exchanges? How can you use crypto to buy milk and bread if your coins are locked up in an illiquid, hard-to-access exchange? 

Today, cryptocurrencies are stores of value, rather than a currency. But that‚Äôs not what the vision was. That‚Äôs not what cryptocurrencies were meant to do. If we are to experience the true benefits of cryptocurrencies, then we need to use them for what they were intended: a currency.

It‚Äôs a chicken and egg situation: crypto is still seen as the Wild West due to the lack of regulation and price volatility, which means most people don‚Äôt want to use cryptocurrencies to buy everyday items. But in order to achieve more stable prices and regulatory approval, people need to start using it as a currency. So where do we start?

There‚Äôs one place to start: by bypassing crypto exchanges altogether. Let‚Äôs dive into the main issues with crypto exchanges and what the best alternatives are. 

**The problems with crypto exchanges**

**Lack of accessibility**

The barrier to entry for the layman to start buying crypto is still high. The first place a ‚Äúcrypto-curious‚Äù person usually goes is a crypto exchange, but these are often confusing and don‚Äôt educate the user on the benefits of cryptocurrencies. Instead, exchanges focus on getting users to join in on the hype and start speculating, trading, and being part of a gambling game. 

When a user successfully signs up to hold crypto on an exchange, it‚Äôs still practically impossible to use cryptocurrencies for everyday needs because everything first needs to be converted to fiat (nerd talk for US Dollar). Modern-day crypto holders find themselves holding multiple online and offline wallets, memorizing several keys and passwords, and having to complete two-factor authentication over and over again. Combine this with a lack of transparency, poor customer service, and lack of regulation, and we find ourselves with the furthest thing from a user experience that would encourage mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. . The result: today, most cryptocurrencies are locked up in cold wallets, keeping prices volatile and cryptocurrencies as an asset, rather than a currency. 

**Inefficient**

The modern-day crypto enthusiast holds multiple hot wallets, a cold wallet, several bank accounts, brokerage accounts, and savings accounts. It‚Äôs still a headache to manage money, especially when crypto is involved. Having to juggle ten different financial apps and constantly transferring cryptocurrencies from one to another is not the most user-friendly way to use crypto. Every time a user decides to open an account with a new crypto exchange, the situation gets even more complicated, not to mention, expensive. 

**Prone to security issues** 

One of the biggest problems facing exchanges is the lack of security. Crypto exchanges have suffered hack after hack, with the latest one being a[ $150 million loss from the exchange KuCoin](https://www.zdnet.com/article/kucoin-cryptocurrency-exchange-hacked-for-150-million/#:~:text=KuCoin%20said%20the%20hacker%20managed,some%20of%20the%20stolen%20funds.).

After the hack happened, Kucoin blocked all deposits and withdrawals and chose to ignore customers‚Äô questions. The average person won‚Äôt put their money into an account that is deemed risky, prone to security breaches, and is handled by an unresponsive team. 

For real mass adoption, we need crypto accounts to be treated like regular bank accounts which can only happen once crypto accounts are backed by governments and regulations. The good news is that this is already starting to happen‚Ä¶

**The solution**

How do we help cryptocurrencies go mainstream with these inefficiencies of crypto exchanges? 

Below are some of the things that could help salvage the situation:

**Crypto debit cards**

Credit and debit cards are still the most convenient and easiest way to purchase everyday items.As more crypto cards are becoming available, there is interest from users to earn rewards while using their cards. The crypto card functions like a traditional credit card but they pay rewards in digital currencies like BTC and the rest.

Crypto cards are also always backed by card issuers like Visa and MasterCard. It's a new way of spending that every crypto enthusiast should be exploring. Some of the Crypto cards I have found really interesting are;

Crypto.com card which gives its returns in CRO( it's token). There are a lot of incentives while using this card which includes 10% back on Airbnb and Expedia purchases, 100% back on your Amazon prime, Netflix and Spotify purchases. Crypto.com is compatible with more than 90 different cryptocurrencies so it's widely used.

Another option which I have personally explored and is suitable for me is the[ 6banc.com](https://www.6banc.com/) card which has no ATM fees, Overdraft, minimum balance. Moreover, one can use Six to withdraw cash from 60,000 ATMs at places like Walgreens, CVS, and 7-Eleven. For me personally I find this to be cost friendly. They have a couple of options with their card from, for personal, business and Crypto payment options.

**Open exchange** 

The US Government[ issued a letter last year](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/occ-allows-banks-to-hold-cryptocurrency-assets-for-safekeeping) that made waves in the crypto industry. The US regulator of national banks officially stated that American banks can now provide cryptocurrency custody services on behalf of customers.

That means that your bank account can now hold your cryptocurrency along with your fiat currency (aka your US dollar), and you can start using cryptocurrencies for everyday purposes straight from your bank account.

Banks can therefore enable an open exchange: the average person will be able to transfer crypto directly into their bank account, send it to other people, and use it to purchase items. As you can see, this effectively bypasses crypto exchanges: who needs a third-party crypto exchange when you can buy, sell, hold and use crypto directly and securely from your bank account?

This is key to making crypto mainstream and is the first sign that crypto exchanges will quickly fall by the wayside.

**Crypto to build credit**

What if you could use crypto to build your credit score and secure loans? People use credit cards to help build credit, receive credit rewards, and secure loans. With over[ 200 million Americans](https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/ownership-statistics/) currently using credit cards, there are a lot of opportunities to meet the demand for credit cards through cryptocurrencies.

For demographics with bad credit, this opens up a lot of doors to better financial products. With crypto bank accounts, financial institutions could use cryptocurrencies as a reserve to offer credit cards. Users could then build credit based on the strength of their cryptocurrency wallet, opening up accessibility to mortgages, auto loans, etc. 

**Invest & borrow using crypto currency** 

Currently, your checking account balance sits in a bank‚Äôs money market account where it gains a small amount of interest over time. With crypto, banks will do the same: your crypto will be generating returns even when it‚Äôs sitting quietly in your bank account. In an ideal world, your crypto earns a return that helps you beat inflation, save for retirement, and enjoy the benefits of compound interest. On the ‚Äúborrow‚Äù side, banks will enable fiat loans based on your crypto balances, very much like a secured loan. Crypto exchanges will be a thing of the past as banks catch up. Now with government support, they are.

**Conclusion** 

We don‚Äôt believe crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance will die. However, over time it‚Äôs likely that they will turn into exchanges similar to OTC markets where penny stocks live. These exchanges will be used by traders who want to have fun, create pump and dump schemes, and trade altcoins..",2,15,False," No one wants it to be a currency anymore, a value of storage is good enough‚Ä¶. And guess what you can trade currencies in exchanges too! Forex is a thing. The notion that cryptocurrencies are just ""currencies"" is a bit outdated IMO. You could say that was true for Blockchain 1.0, but even then there were already many ideas how cc could be used in other ways and have more utilities than normal currencies.",0.501

LaLiga has today announced a multi-year partnership with ‚ÄòCrypto-made-easy‚Äô pioneer, [Divi](https://diviwallet.com/) to become its official crypto wallet for the MENA, South East Asia & China regions**.** A world first for a football league, the deal will raise awareness of Divi‚Äôs wallet to an audience of over 1 billion.

Aligned through shared values of driving innovation and creating  meaningful customer relationships through rich, engaging experiences,  Divi was selected because of its focus on accessibility and ease-of-use,  social inclusion, and education. 

The regions covered by the deal are considered by many experts to be  emerging as the next crypto capitals. According to LaLiga‚Äô s latest  research, they are also areas where crypto is taking off amongst fans.  Data from this year reveals that 1 in 10 fans in the MENA region are  crypto investors and 6 out of 10 crypto investors in the MENA region are  LaLiga fans.

‚ÄúCrypto is being embraced by football fans and we want to bring in  partners who demonstrate our understanding of what‚Äôs important to them  and align with our values. In that regard, Divi Labs was an obvious  choice,‚Äù said **Oscar Mayo, Executive Director at LaLiga. ¬®Much like LaLiga they are a challenger brand that is innovating its sector.**  Like us they are driven to deliver the very best experience to their  fans. But perhaps most importantly, they, like us, care about building  close links with their community and are driven to leave a long-lasting  positive impact on everyone they reach.‚Äù

The partnership will push the boundaries of brand activation through a  comprehensive schedule of activities. Areas include the creation of  unique content and player-driven experiences that will help educate fans  about crypto, leveraging of key LaLiga assets and platforms including,  TV, experiential events, & the integration of CSR initiatives to  build awareness of, and facilitate access to, essential services in  local communities experiencing challenges that can be solved through  crypto.

‚ÄúOur partnership with LaLiga gives us a powerful platform from which  to reach and engage new audiences around the world and deliver on our  mission to enable people from all walks of life to engage in the crypto  economy and achieve financial freedom and inclusion,‚Äù said **Nick Saponaro, CEO, Divi Labs**.  ‚ÄúCritically, it also offers a launchpad from which to get our products  into the hands of people who need them most. The partnership will enable  us to accelerate the creation of real-world initiatives that help some  of the most in-need communities on the planet.‚Äù

By removing barriers to entry, innovating new frictionless  technologies, and delivering use cases for the developed and developing  world, Divi Labs is on a mission to help people across the globe to  engage in the crypto economy and achieve financial freedom and  inclusion. Its self-custodial mobile wallet comes loaded with innovative  features that deliver on the company‚Äôs promise of individual control  and financial sovereignty. They include Divi‚Äôs patented 1-Click  Masternode (MOCCI‚Ñ¢) and staking vault technologies that make earning and  owning crypto as easy as pressing play on Spotify.

Now that the hard work has been done and its core technologies have  been implemented, Divi Labs‚Äô next step is to bridge into DeFi and work  with LaLiga, its audience and partners to shape the roadmap by defining  the features they‚Äôd like to come next.¬†

Classes teaching crypto and a better understanding of finances, and how the economy works, trading etc... Would all be greatly beneficial to them since most students are forging this path that's filled with unknowns so crypto can be a launchpad to start from. 

Spaces for students to create and share their crypto ideas and going into their own personal investments which would help them cover finances, student debt and a lot of other expenses that college students struggle with through crypto.
