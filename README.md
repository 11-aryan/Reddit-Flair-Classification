# Reddit-Flair-Classification
Each Reddit post is tagged for filtering purposes. These tags are called **flairs** in the Reddit world. 

In this project, a comparative data analysis using existing Machine Learning and Natural language processing techniques is provided to detect the flair of each Reddit post using the data generated by webscraping reddit using **PRAW** (Python Reddit API Wrapper). 

Data analysis was done on the data using different features and a pipeline of various natural language processing techniques like *Count Vectorization* and *Tfldf Transformation*, and various machine learning techniques like , *Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Naive-Bayes, pretrained BERT*, was used to research on the data, and classify the flairs
